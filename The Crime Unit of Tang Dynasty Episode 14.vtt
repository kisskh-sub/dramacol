00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:57.500
Lin Xiaoran

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.583
Why are you buried here?

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.625
How did you know I was here?

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.291
I was just wandering around.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.791
We really are fated to meet.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.291
Lin Xiaoran

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.166
Lin Xiaoran

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.083
Wake up.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.500
There’s definitely something wrong with this manor.

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:27.000
Most likely.

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:29.333
Everyone else is gone.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.083
What should we do now?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.875
We can sleep for now.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.333
Thank you, Butler Wang.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:04.625
Official Li, please try this.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.583
See if it suits your taste.

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.916
Butler Wang is not only a skilled cook,

00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:12.583
I recall his literary talent is impressive too.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:15.250
Serving among the old master’s famous disciples,

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.958
is truly a waste of his talent.

00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:20.208
Official Li, you flatter me.

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:28.791
Heroine Shen

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.791
Try this calming soup.

00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.666
I don’t like soup.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.208
I only like wine.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.875
This calming soup refreshes the mind.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.083
It’s great for your health.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:44.500
I said I won’t drink it.

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.708
Sorry, Butler Wang.

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.041
My subordinate isn’t very polite.

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:59.958
You must have put a lot of effort into making this soup.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.000
I’ve said it before.

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:12.583
Those who deserve to die

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.375
can’t hide, even if they try.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.208
Since you stepped into this manor,

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:26.500
don’t expect to leave alive.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:30.208
Go die like your friends.

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:31.208
Stop!

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.583
No wonder.

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:41.208
So it’s you, the troublesome ghost.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.125
I was careless.

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:48.166
Only the dead are clean in this manor.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.125
You shouldn’t have come back to life.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.500
So my deduction was correct.

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:54.416
You faked your death.

00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.083
You made everyone in the manor turn on each other.

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:03.125
Then used the black handprint to confuse everyone.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.000
Letting an outsider like me expose the vengeful spirit story.

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:08.708
So you could carry out your plan.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:10.708
You pretended to be dead.

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.083
So I wouldn’t suspect you as the killer.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:15.250
But I overlooked something.

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.875
Since you’re skilled with herbs,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.166
faking your death would be easy.

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.125
After that,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.833
you used rosemary to kill Gao Li and Teng Rong.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.041
But you didn’t expect the old master and Lian Songbai to fight each other.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.708
That way, you killed everyone in the manor without lifting a finger.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:40.500
Am I right?

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:42.041
Butler Wang

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.708
You’re completely right.

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:50.583
But you only guessed half of it.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.916
He Yun, you’re working with him.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:57.791
That’s right. They all deserve to die.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.916
Butler Wang Zheng only did what he had to do.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.083
Why did you do this?

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:04.333
Why?

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:07.625
All the filth of those masters and disciples before,

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.958
Don’t you remember?

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.125
They were all hypocrites.

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:15.250
Yet they enjoyed fame as great scholars.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.458
While true talents like us

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.166
remained unknown and treated like dogs.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:23.750
Lonely Inscription Manor should have been mine.

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.083
The reputation of a celebrated Tang scholar should have been mine too.

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:29.791
All these years,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.000
I was imprisoned by you, living worse than death.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.333
All your acclaimed works

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.791
were ghostwritten by me.

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:40.916
Even if I have to crawl today,

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:43.333
I’ll crawl out of here.

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:48.750
Let the world see your true, hypocritical face.

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:56.541
Heaven is unjust.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.666
Bai Hua was my only soulmate.

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:09.083
The old manor lord was a fraud who deceived the world.

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:12.125
He framed his disciple, crippled him, and imprisoned him to ghostwrite.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.916
And his so-called top disciples

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.458
were a den of thieves, cunning and deceitful.

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.375
They deserve to die.

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:22.458
I want them, before they die,

00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.416
to reveal their ugliest, filthiest nature.

00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.625
Let them tear each other apart.

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.666
The wealth and fame they possess

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.083
should belong to those truly talented.

00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:35.333
So you mean

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.708
you are the truly talented one?

00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.666
That's right.

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:41.333
They all saw me as a lowly servant.

00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:44.625
Just a worthless, insignificant old slave.

00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:48.958
I have talent but never dared to show it.

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:52.375
Afraid I'd end up like Bai Hua.

00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:55.041
But the world shouldn't be like this.

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:58.708
The fame and glory of Gu Ming Manor

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:02.333
should belong to people like me and Bai Hua.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.166
Lin Xiaoran.

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:11.833
He Yun, put down the knife.

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:14.041
You.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.041
You all.

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:15.833
Butler Wang.

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:17.666
If we hadn't done this,

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.875
we wouldn't have heard your heartfelt confession.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.750
What a wronged, talented scholar you are.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.375
You're just using Bai Hua's revenge as an excuse

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:26.833
to achieve your own goals.

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.375
How are you any different from those you killed?

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.041
He Yun, kill him.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.041
Kill all three of them.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.625
Then we can live like immortals.

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:42.208
He Yun, don't do anything foolish.

00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.916
I'm in charge of the manor now.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.166
Kill him.

00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.541
He Yun.

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:50.166
Kill him.

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.083
Kill him.

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:54.750
Kill him.

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.916
He Yun, kill him.

00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:59.833
Kill him! Kill him!

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:37.208
Kill him.

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:44.791
Butler Wang.

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:45.750
Stay back.

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.916
Just leave now.

00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:49.958
At least for all the scholars,

00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:53.875
Gu Ming Manor remains a pure land in their hearts.

00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.250
Trust me.

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:58.375
Only I am worthy of this place.

00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:16.291
Since childhood,

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:19.375
I've lived among ghosts.

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:24.708
Always searching for someone among them who could truly help me.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.541
In the end,

00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:35.250
This life has been a mistake, disgusting.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.833
Butler Wang, don't keep making the same mistakes.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.166
I've had enough.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.250
Butler Wang.

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.041
He Yun.

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:17.583
I never want to set foot in this cursed place again.

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:18.625
You have no idea

00:10:18.666 --> 00:10:21.375
how many scholars and gentlemen long for this place.

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.083
Senior Sister, look at mine.

00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:29.583
Great poem! Brilliant, truly brilliant.

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:31.416
Senior Brother, look at what I wrote.

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:33.416
I'm very satisfied.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.708
No need to be so polite with me.

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:50.333
Li Jingnian, why are you standing there? Hurry up!

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:02.958
The place remains, but the people are no more.

00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:06.291
The past is now but dust.

00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:11.791
Li Jingnian.

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:12.666
What's wrong?

00:11:12.791 --> 00:11:14.416
We're kindred spirits now.

00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958
Tell me, if I ever become like Bai Hua,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.083
what would you do?

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.208
Lin Xiaoran.

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:21.916
Huh?

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:23.291
I'd keep a distance.

00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:26.958
I...

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:30.333
Official Li.

00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.291
The manor is ownerless now.

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:33.375
What do you plan to do with it?

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:34.958
I've already reported to Prince Kang.

00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:37.375
Prince Kang will take over the manor on behalf of the court.

00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:39.416
He will welcome those with true talent.

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.083
I hope from now on

00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:43.916
it will truly become a sanctuary for all scholars.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.125
After all we've been through,

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.833
shouldn't we head straight to Chang'an?

00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.333
Yes, but there's something more urgent right now.
