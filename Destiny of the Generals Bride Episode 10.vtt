=Episode 10=

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.920
What's going on?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.039
It's so high.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.480
She shouldn't do anything foolish.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:27.280
Yun Juan!

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:28.719
Yun Juan, calm down!

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.160
If you have any grievance, tell me.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.280
I'll help you.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.240
She jumped!

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.079
Hua,

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.159
Yun Juan's affairs have been settled.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.599
I just wish
I could've caught Xiao Ye earlier.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.079
Hua, it's not your fault

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.319
we couldn't save Yun Juan.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.439
You mustn't blame yourself.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.480
Hua,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.200
according to the ledger

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.959
Yun Juan gave us,

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.599
Xiao Lian was sold here.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.680
Our abilities are limited.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.840
We can't save every woman.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.519
The only thing we can do

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.319
is to bring Xiao Ye to justice

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.280
and send a message
to the men with bad intentions.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.879
That might be

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.480
the only thing we can do for them.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.359
Got a business offer for you.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120
How about this?

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.360
If you two can afford this price,

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.919
then surely

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.599
the goods you want
must be far from ordinary.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.159
There's someone I want
to find through you.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.280
Who?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.719
Last year,
on the 17th of the 5th month,

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.879
the Xiao family's Second Master
sold someone to you.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.199
Her name is Xiao Lian.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.479
Since you know
it was the Xiao family's Second Master,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.960
you should know

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.599
he took the King of Xiling
as his sworn father.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.000
If I refuse you,

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.360
I'll only lose some money.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.680
But if I tell you,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.080
I'll be buying my coffin.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360
Please, state your terms.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.159
I see you both dressed well.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.879
Yet you dare

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.159
to come here without any protection.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.560
You don't know not to flaunt wealth.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.599
You just got here

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.599
and you're already pulling out
such a big ingot.

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.919
Even if I'm dull,

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.560
I'd never

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.159
do business with you two.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.960
Please leave.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.000
Nan Jiang, let's go.

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:25.000
Come on.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.000
Stand down.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.319
You're trying

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.120
to murder your own husband?

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.920
These men will follow you from now on.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480
They'll keep you safe.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
I don't need them.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.480
Aren't you going to ask why I'm here?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.040
No matter where you go,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.079
I won't interfere.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.360
This is my business.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.480
You and I are only
husband and wife in name.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.600
Didn't you promise

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.279
to bring Hua back?

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.000
Protecting you means protecting Hua.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.480
Isn't that right?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.160
My smile is unlike anyone else's.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.600
- Smile then.
- Give us a smile.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.639
You can't tell from my smile

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.720
that I was just sold

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.319
by my own husband.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.519
You came here looking for a good time.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.759
The key

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.560
to having fun

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.759
is pretending.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.879
No one's better at pretending than me.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.319
Even when betrayed by my husband,

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.680
my smile remains just as sweet.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.759
Su Man'er got what she deserved.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.199
You don't need to pity her.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.290
You should take care of her
once and for all.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.879
This is my own matter.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.560
No need for you to concern yourself.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.920
Thanks for helping me today.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.360
However,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.480
we're only husband and wife in name.

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:41.959
You don't have to worry about me.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.439
Please leave.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.920
Nan Jiang.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.560
Go buy Su Man'er back.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.980
(Xiao Residence)

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.160
Qing Yan.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.959
I've heard from Ye that, now that
you're overseeing the household affairs,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.399
(Zhang Yuanxing, Uncle)
you've been cutting the allowance at will,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.160
causing quite an uproar.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.199
Who are you?

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.319
Who am I?

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:44.399
I'm the Minister of Revenue,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.720
Grand Madam Xiao's brother by blood,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.560
and the uncle of Xiao Ye and Xiao Yun.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:52.079
You don't even show proper respect

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.040
when you see an elder.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.519
No greeting, no acknowledgement.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.360
Such terrible manners.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.800
Without General's mother here,

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:03.800
there is no uncle to speak of.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.519
How insolent!

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.560
Today, I'm going to teach you

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.000
how a proper noble family behaves.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.480
What wind

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.879
knocked you over?

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:18.360
You...

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.439
How can you be so shameless!

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.079
I'm shameless, I admit it.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.319
But meeting you,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.120
I see we're both
equally lacking in manners.

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:30.480
I'd heard you swindle money.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:33.559
I wondered what kind of woman
could be so shameless.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.279
Now I've seen for myself.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.799
Not only are you black-hearted,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.639
your mouth is foul as well!

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:45.159
I sent Yun Juan

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.799
to take out that thorn.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.679
But after falling ill

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:53.320
and waking from a long sleep,
this is the result.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.480
Please, don't be upset.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.320
Su Man'er got what she deserved

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.320
for trying to harm you.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:02.519
She's wicked

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.679
but sharp.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.120
Back when she supported Ye,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.080
I felt a bit reassured.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.200
But now that Su Man'er is gone.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.320
Ye is kind but naive.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.960
He's bound to suffer at the hands
of his older brother and sister-in-law.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.639
I have to ask you and my brother

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.799
to help Ye.

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:25.240
Rest assured.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.960
We'll give it our all.

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.759
We must have that wench know

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.360
this household won't tolerate
her evil deeds.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:34.320
This is the residence of the Xiao.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.360
Hua, everything's taken care of.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.000
I just ran into that Hu merchant.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:47.559
I bought every bit of Suhe Luo he had.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:52.600
Master Zhang, your body

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:53.879
is rather frail.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.120
You should head home

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.559
and rest up properly.

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:57.519
We wouldn't want

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.120
to let a fly trip you up some day.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.120
Suhe Luo?

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:30.039
You bought Su Man'er's freedom.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.120
You've kept a close eye on me.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.759
If I want, there's nothing you do

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.360
that I don't know about.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.600
Your influence reaches far and wide.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.120
I'm impressed.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.559
I'm not here to argue.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.559
I just don't understand.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.120
Why would you do that
after all she did to you?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.600
Only women can understand women.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.559
She had simply loved the wrong man.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.919
And you?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.720
Have you loved the wrong man?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.519
You should get some rest.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.080
Why ask such pointless questions?

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:25.559
This is the courtyard where I grew up.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.320
This is my door.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.559
That's my bed inside.

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:31.279
Isn't it too unreasonable

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.120
to ask me to leave?

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.320
Then, I'll go.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.559
You made the first move that night.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:46.799
And now you want me gone?

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.480
Changed your mind so soon?

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.159
I... I don't remember making
the first move.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.879
How about this?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.759
Still can't remember anything?

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.279
Maybe if I get a little closer,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.720
I can help you remember.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.000
You should go back and rest.
