00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.680
We're in trouble, Master.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.120
Khem's disappeared.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.360
Your instincts are strong.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.440
Focus your mind on Khem,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.280
and follow wherever your gut leads you.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.960
I have cherished and protected you

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.520
for over 80 years.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.400
How could I let you be taken
by someone else so easily?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.800
Master,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.520
can you please stay with me for now?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.040
At least until I fall asleep.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.050
I've got to thank Chayod

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.530
for giving me the idea
to forge this realm.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.410
Since you're so bent on shutting me out,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.520
I shall make you come to me instead.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.280
Stop it, Ramphueng.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.360
You know my name?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.200
Always so eager to stir up trouble.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.960
I was minding my own path.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.200
It is you who came to provoke me.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.360
The more lives you drag into your chaos,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.520
the greater the weight of sin upon you.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.480
You think sin frightens me?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.880
You can never lay a hand on me.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.560
Stay out of my way.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.920
Even you can feel worried, can't you?

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.800
Your spell is going to be undone
before long.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.120
Do you think my power ends here?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.440
Stop it, you damn ghost!

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.760
Aw, little ones.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.520
How adorable.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.000
Good,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.880
now that you're all here,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.160
I'll wipe you out at once.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.560
You think you possess the power
to act against me?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.680
We got you.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.640
You couldn't see it, huh?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.480
Boo!

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.720
- Boo.
- Boo!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.790
- Master!
- Master...

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.040
- Master...
- Master!

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.400
Come on, wake up!

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.560
Master!

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600
Master...

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.400
She almost got you.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.640
Are you harmed, Master?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.600
- Master!
- Master!

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.520
- Master...
- Master!

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440
Master...

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.320
Master...

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.920
Why are you here?

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.560
Did something happen to Khem?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.840
He is doing well.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.440
I just came to say farewell.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.159
You have always felt my presence,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.110
and it made me feel touched.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.280
Our bond has endured a long time.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.920
Even if I can't see you,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.040
I can sense that
you've always been around our son.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.440
Is it finally your time

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.760
to rest in peace?

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.320
I am truly grateful

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.280
for everything.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.200
Thank you for the love
you've shown me and our son,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.720
even knowing what was to come.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.160
I never saw it that way,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.480
neither in the moments
I shared with you,

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.870
nor in the time
I had left for ordination,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.980
hoping to extend our son's life.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.820
All I did was with love,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.360
and I did it willingly.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.840
No need to cry.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.280
Let us part with happiness.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.240
Have you said goodbye to Khem yet?

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.480
Our son has grown up so well,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.760
and he's always been cherished
by everyone.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.360
Now that I've found
the person who can help him,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.960
I feel at ease.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.960
Hasn't Grand Master Sek
passed away long ago?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.000
- Master!
- Master!

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.800
- Master...
- Master!

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.040
- Master!
- Master!

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.440
There is another person,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.920
someone even more blessed
than Grand Master Sek.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.640
Master!

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.540
Master...

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.680
And what matters most is that,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.120
though he may not realize it himself,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.600
I believe we can place our son's future
in his care.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Then I can be at ease.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.680
You'll finally rest.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.760
May you find peace in another life.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.240
I shall follow you one day.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
Please don't hurry.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.120
If there is another life beyond this,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.000
I hope our paths cross once more.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640
Right.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.880
I hope so, too.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.480
The warding shield is still intact,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.560
and Ramphueng has yet to breach it.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.560
If so,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.800
how did she manage
to draw you into her realm?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.480
What were you doing before that, Master?

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.000
I left my body to go save the villagers.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.440
What do you guys know?

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.440
Don't keep me in the dark alone.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.110
Ramphueng seized the chance
and pulled Master's spirit away

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.470
while it was outside the house.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.760
And?

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.400
Should he leave his body once more,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.600
it shall be pulled into her realm again.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720
So that means...

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.320
he can't leave his body ever again?

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.840
I still have to
watch over the villagers.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.920
I'll never know when
or what might happen

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.920
to them again.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.510
Then from now on,
you can leave this duty to me and Thong.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.760
Right, Master.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.200
We've got this.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.640
You don't need to
project your spirit anymore.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.680
We know every nook and cranny
of the village.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.400
You have nothing to worry about.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.360
Okay.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.240
Guard yourselves well.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.320
If danger comes,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.120
flee at once.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.160
You are my family.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200
Do you understand?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.640
Yes, Master.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.560
Our duty is to keep an eye
on everything.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.560
If anything happens,
we'll let you know right away.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.920
There's no danger.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.360
You should rest now, Master.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.000
We can rest assured
that everyone is safe.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.520
Be a big girl, Dotty.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.200
Don't be too big, though.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.200
Auntie Kaew asked me
to give this to you.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880
This smells so good.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.560
Look, Jet.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.960
Jet and Khem are up to something.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.360
They're watering all the plants

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.960
and polishing the floors
until they shine like mirrors.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.080
And they're making tons of food.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.640
It looks so good!

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.990
Hey, you're dropping everything.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.080
What's wrong, Jet?

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.960
So, you're annoyed
just seeing Charn walk by?

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.480
No!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.200
I'm just thinking

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.319
if I should tell him the truth.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960
Why would you?

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.839
Didn't you want to keep it a secret?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.520
Well... Uh...

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760
I don't know.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.440
He helped us without even asking.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.720
You know how nosy he usually is.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.600
I'm afraid his curiosity might kill him.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240
Go ahead.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.400
I'm fine with it.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.320
But,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.560
Jet, don't you actually hate him?

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.400
Well...

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.520
I mean...

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.960
He's just annoying.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.360
I don't exactly hate him.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.880
I just feel that he can be trusted

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.940
if we need more help.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.040
Aw,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.360
since when did you guys become besties?

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400
What are you talking about?

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.240
Right,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.860
why is Master sleeping in so much today?

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.800
I'll store the food
in the cabinet first.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.760
Come on.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.120
Grand Master,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.440
I hope your grandson likes me a lot.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.560
Your legs are fine.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.970
I suppose you can stand on your own.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.860
Khem,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.170
are you flirting with Master?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.920
Jet!

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.840
Master,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.120
Khem got up really early this morning
to clean the house.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.880
He even made some food.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.120
And?

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.720
Uh...

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.720
Well, I mean...

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.320
May I stay here
until the semester break ends?

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.480
Please.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.840
Please, Master.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.280
I promise I'll help lighten your load,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.200
and I will never cause you
any trouble, Master.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.880
Please, Master.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.240
He won't give you any problems.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.560
If anything happens,
I'll handle it myself.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.280
If you want to, just stay.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.920
No need to make it complicated.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.680
Yes!

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.080
You'll soon pick up
the dialect so well, man.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.840
Hey!

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.320
Thank you, Master.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.560
What?

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.880
Are you not returning to Bangkok, Khem?

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720
You sure you'll return
after your birthday?

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.000
Yeah.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.480
That's a relief.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.640
I was worried
you'd give up on your studies.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.040
Gosh,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.400
that was like a whole podcast,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.720
but that's what makes you feel relieved?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.040
Are you not surprised that he's cursed?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.600
Well,

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.400
at this point, I'm getting used to it.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.160
Though it feels unbelievable,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.090
I've witnessed it with my own eyes.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.880
I can't change that fact.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.800
Khem, you're really strong,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.580
to have come this far.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.960
Thanks, Charn.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.640
As soon as I return to Bangkok,

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.200
let's have a meal together.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.920
Alright, everyone.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.520
Put your hands together.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.920
I shall now begin the ritual
of calling your vital force.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.360
And then our voices say:

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.910
May fortune come.
This is an auspicious day.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.320
Together we gather, together we pray.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.840
The venerable shaman
declares it a blessed day.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.040
This is an auspicious day.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.520
Together we gather, together we pray.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.880
The venerable shaman
declares it a blessed day.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.080
It's a day of fortune, a day of light.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.320
With the offerings adorned with delight,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.320
we now summon the vital force
through this rite:

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.560
May your vital force come forth.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.360
- Bye-bye.
- Have a safe trip, guys.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.080
- Bye-bye.
- Get home safely.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.320
Have a safe trip, kids.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.760
I'll see you soon.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.080
Thanks for everything.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.720
- Tell me when you're back.
- Sure.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.000
Have a safe trip.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.680
Let me know when you're there.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.040
Bye-bye.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.880
Goodbye, guys.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.520
- Come back again, okay?
- Safe journey to you all.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.400
Here are the monks.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.080
- Namaskar.
- Sadhu.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.400
Behave yourselves, alright?

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.600
- Good luck!
- Good luck, guys.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.320
Have a safe trip, guys.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.760
We've really made so many friends
at this camp.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.960
I'll come again next year.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.350
Let's go, guys.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.640
- Come on, let's go home.
- Let's go.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.480
Guys,

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.460
we're leaving.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.920
- Goodbye.
- See you later.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.000
- See you.
- Thank you so much.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.240
- We'll see you later.
- Okay.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880
Are you serious?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.400
It's not too late to change your mind.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560
I've made up my mind.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.240
Can I please stay here, too, Master?

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.920
By choosing to board the same boat,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.240
you accept that if danger comes,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.160
you're ready to give your lives
for one another.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.560
You think you can handle that?

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.120
I can.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.080
Give me that.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.040
What the heck is in here?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080
It's freaking heavy.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.000
It's books.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320
For killing time.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.800
If it's too heavy,
just hand it over to me.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.840
Hurry up.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.760
We need to prepare the offerings
for Master, too.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:13.920
Come on.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
It's so damn heavy.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520
Wait up.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960
Jet, Charn...

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720
Whoa...

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.880
Shit.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.000
Grandma Si had some stuff,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.160
so I borrowed a few.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.520
Also,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.600
there was a banana grove on the way,

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.480
so I cut some more.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.160
They should be useful.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.240
Wait, did you even ask them
before you cut these?

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960
I didn't...

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.050
What?

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.840
I didn't fail to!

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.400
You're afraid, huh?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.400
Do you want anything
to go with your coffee, Master?

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.400
I'll bring it over for you.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.280
No.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880
Just get that done.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.320
What's with him?

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.840
One minute he's nice,
the next he's cold.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.360
Whoa,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.800
it truly shows that
you're arts students.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.720
Let's take it easy next time.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.760
My fingers are in pain.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.740
Come on,

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.020
we need to give it our all, you know.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.960
If you want to stay here,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.040
you have to be my disciples.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.000
I'll teach you some magic, too.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.080
Alright.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960
No need.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.240
Charn will do it alone.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.920
Why, though?

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.520
To become my disciple,

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.760
you must honor me as your master

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.120
without any hint of disrespect, harm,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.320
or impure motives.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.560
If you break this vow,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.960
no one will be able to save you.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.620
Understood.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.460
Alright.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.960
With all respect,

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.460
I, Charnvit Panichakorn,

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.740
offer myself
to serve as your faithful disciple

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.420
and vow never to bring
dishonor to your name.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.180
Come here.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.540
May your life prosper
in the four blessings:

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.380
longevity, beauty,
happiness, and health.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.820
And may all your desires be fulfilled.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.200
Go into the forest

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.320
and look for red pieces of paper
rolled like this.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.000
Whichever roll you find first,

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.120
take that one.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.760
Okay, Master.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.640
Be careful.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.200
The forest has a territory holder,
you know.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.880
You'll go with him, Jet.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.560
What?

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.480
Why do I have to?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.960
Jet, Charn, good luck.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.120
Come on. Follow me.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.880
Hurry and come back.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.280
I'll have something tasty
waiting for you.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.520
Hey.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:10.960
Hey.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.280
Do you know how to make alms flowers?

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:20.639
Uh...

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.000
Yes.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.760
He should've told me
he didn't want me as his disciple.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.160
My hands are all messed up.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.240
Wait and see,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.720
I'll make these flowers
as weird as possible.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.360
Have you found any?

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480
Not yet.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.480
You should help me find one.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.620
Why are you scared?

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.340
It's not even dark yet.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.560
Because it's not dark yet,

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.040
Phrai, the territory holder,
is still awake.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.480
Phrai?

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120
Who's that?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.280
Is there really paper in here?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.680
The wind may have blown it away.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.640
Charn...

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920
Jet!

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.880
Behind you.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040
What's behind me?

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.090
Phrai,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720
this is Charn.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.960
Hey, Charn,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
this is Phrai.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.560
On three, we'll run.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.880
I haven't counted yet!

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.600
Charn, wait up!

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.060
Jet!

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
Jet, Charn!

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.120
You're back?

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.200
Whoa...

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.600
Here, Master.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.360
I found it.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720
You asshole!

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:39.460
Master's up here.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.380
That's Dotty.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.760
Where are your glasses?

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.760
How are you supposed to see?

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.240
It's alright.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.000
I have another pair upstairs.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.920
Keep this with you.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.640
It'll guard you when you're in danger.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.920
But you must not break any precepts.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.080
Thank you, Master.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.640
So, what about me?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.480
Am I getting one, too?

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.300
I've given you
a wooden Buddha amulet, haven't I?

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.720
But...

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.400
does that mean
I did all that for nothing?

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.680
I should at least get something.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960
What do you want?

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080
Well...

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.920
I wanna see Thong and Ake again.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.560
Can you please...

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.640
remove the spell blocking my sight?

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.400
Jet...

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.520
Jet's here!

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.440
Hey, Thong, Ake!

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.920
Jet, did you bring anything for us?

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960
Here.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.520
There you go.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.120
Yay!

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.400
Thong, Master might not be
very happy with that.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.800
I got one for you, too.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280
I got it.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960
Jet,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.800
will you really not be able
to see us anymore?

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.120
Master's so mean.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.880
Why isn't he helping you at all?

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.040
Don't blame him.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.280
My dad told him to do it.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.400
Not even he could go against it.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.840
But it's okay.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.010
I believe that

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.840
even if I can't see you two,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.760
I'll always feel your presence
beside me.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.870
Let's hug.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.880
Are you sure about this, Jet?

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.040
It's not something that can be
switched on and off so often.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.380
I am, Master.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.640
What about your dad?

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.680
Can he handle this?

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.920
My dad wanted you to block my sight

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.640
'cause I was always talking to ghosts
and had no human friends.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.760
But now,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.320
I do have friends.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.600
Besides,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.760
I've grown up, too.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.800
My dad should understand that.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.760
Alright, let's do it, then.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.200
Close your eyes.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.000
Focus your mind
on the center of your body.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.840
Open your eyes slowly.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.480
Don't rush it.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.800
- Jet!
- Jet!

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.000
Take this.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440
There you go.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.320
- Jet...
- Take this!

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.520
Take it easy.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.720
Jet's not used to it yet.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.850
- Okay, Master.
- Okay, Master.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:23.940
Take this.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.520
There you go!

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.720
You haven't grown up at all, have you?

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.280
You're actually older than me,
I believe.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.000
I suppose I should call you...

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.440
Uncle Thong and Uncle Ake!

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.640
Come here!

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.120
They're Master's kuman thongs.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840
Don't be scared.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.120
I can feel it.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.120
Hearing Jet's laugh,

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.320
I bet they must be so adorable.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.680
Take this.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.320
- Here!
- Hey, come on.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.640
It tickles.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.240
Take this!

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680
Khem,

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.240
why didn't Master
let you take him as your master?

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.280
I wonder that, too.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.560
I still don't get it.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.840
When Master mentioned impure motives,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.560
what exactly did he mean?

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.600
I mean, you wouldn't hurt anyone.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.260
Well...

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.480
I mean,

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.200
I'm asking to be his disciple
because I want to survive.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.240
That's probably an impure motive,

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840
right, Jet?

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.680
But the reason I agreed

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.160
is that I want to help you.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.960
Isn't that impure, too, then?

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.440
Oh, he's right.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.400
That sounds right.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.200
Hey.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.120
You are suspicious, man.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.920
Anything you're keeping from us?

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.840
Tell me.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.040
No!

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:55.840
Well...

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.920
that's the story.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.400
What's wrong?

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480
Say something!

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.920
Oh, my God.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.960
I'm in shock.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.040
So you've actually known him

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.720
longer than I have.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.600
And you've been in love
since your past life.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.800
I don't love him.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.800
It was Khemmika and Pawat.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.880
Is this a coincidence

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.640
or destiny?

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.460
If Jet hadn't brought you here,

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.820
you wouldn't have met him.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.500
Exactly.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.140
Destiny is doing its job too well.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.700
I feel like I'm living in a series.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.080
Come on,

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.600
stop it.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.080
Anyway,

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.410
perhaps he thinks
I just recalled being Khemmika,

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.520
so he might assume

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:08.940
I'm still attached to her feelings.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.880
That's why he didn't accept me
as his disciple.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.800
- But you're into...
- What?

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.280
No buts.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.640
I've known you for ages.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.080
You think I wouldn't notice?

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.680
You can usually tell
what's real and what's not.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.480
Yet here you are,
totally agreeing with him.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.960
Be sincere with me.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.400
Give me an honest answer.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.000
How do you feel about him?

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.560
I mean...

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.300
I...

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.920
I like him.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.160
Gosh!

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.480
I knew it, man!

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.680
I'm totally invested.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.840
What I feel for him

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.660
and what I want him to help me with

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.040
are two separate things.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.880
No matter what, I have to survive first.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.360
As for Master,

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.320
I'm not expecting anything anyway.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.840
He probably has no feelings for me.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.240
So...

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.600
what if I tell you...

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.640
he might think the same way?

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.920
Really, Jet.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.160
Master was coughing up a lot of blood,

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.680
yet the first thing he did
was rush to see Khem.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.080
Right, Thong?

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.360
Yes, and there's more.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.240
When you and Charn went into the forest,

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.480
Master quietly stopped
on the porch steps to watch Khem.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.920
It's true.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.800
We're being honest.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.960
Do you still want to expect nothing?

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.080
Well...

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.520
it's still...

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.280
impossible anyway.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.400
Impossible, my ass.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.040
Not nowadays, Khem.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.880
I agree with you, though, Khem.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.680
Even if he truly has feelings for you,

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.740
he has his duties to uphold,

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.520
so he must follow his precepts

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.560
and maintain a distance from you.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.640
Especially living in the same house,

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.370
he might feel uncomfortable around you.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.800
I think...

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.240
it'd be better if you gave up now.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.360
Are you a Debbie Downer or what?

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.440
Come on now. Let's go to sleep.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.560
Khem, just sleep.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.280
Don't listen to him.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.000
Come on, let's sleep.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.200
Good night.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.760
You had bandages
on your fingers last night, didn't you?

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.560
Right.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:00.980
Khem,

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.640
are they healed now?

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.760
Yeah.

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.440
They were already healed
when I woke up.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.040
Must've been some miracle salve.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:12.880
What?

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.280
Leave already.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.400
Grandma Si is probably starving now.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.160
Let's go.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.640
You're not gonna
change your mind, Master?

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.560
I've told you I'm busy.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.120
Sorry, I'm early.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.880
The traffic was light,

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.700
so I got here quicker.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.840
Jet!

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:38.600
Let me tie your wrist to welcome you.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.800
May you grow and prosper.

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.960
May you be healthy and joyful.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.600
It fills my heart with joy
to have you around.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.120
Sadhu.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.440
Wait, Master had a girlfriend?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.440
Don't take it the wrong way.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.320
I said it was a rumor.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800
Then,

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.960
why were people spreading it?

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.000
Well,

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.240
they were childhood friends.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.200
And before he became who he is today,

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.240
he was super wild, man.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.160
A tech-school boy, you know.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.360
With that look,

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.560
everyone had something to say about him.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.440
They wouldn't spread that rumor

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.000
if there wasn't some truth to it.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.420
Here's the thing.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.440
Master's dad and Prim's were close,

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.480
so they'd often visit each other.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.160
That's why people thought
they'd get married.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.720
But that's all there was.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.920
When I moved in with him,

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.640
Prim had already gone for her studies.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.440
Nothing ever happened.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.560
Even now, they're not alone.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.920
You saw it yourself
that her brother was in the car.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.600
Her younger brother?

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.080
Yeah.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.720
That was Pong.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.520
He rolled down the window
to say hi to us.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.880
Don't worry.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.560
I think...

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.560
there's nothing between them.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:04.670
I stayed up all night thinking.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.080
I was thinking...

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.080
I'm going all in on your ship.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.160
What?

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.000
Is anyone going to board a ship?

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.640
Come on, that's not it.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.400
It's like...

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.120
shipping people, Grandma.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.120
Gosh,

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.320
how do I explain this?

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.880
The gen gap is huge.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.800
Like rooting for a couple?

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.000
What?

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.720
You know?

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.160
Of course I do.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.480
I heard Chompoo
talked to her friends about that.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.120
So, what couple are you talking about?

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.440
Uh...

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.440
They're around here.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.320
I mean, one person in that relationship

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.000
is close to me.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.840
He's not so sure

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.200
if his crush has feelings for him.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.440
And they're pretty different, Grandma.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.600
Each of them
also has their own duties to handle.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.400
So I figured...

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.080
it's better to be prepared.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.840
Why would you stress out for him?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.240
This is not your business.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.320
It's got nothing to do with you guys.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.400
But if you want him
to get what he wants,

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.640
there might be a way.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.520
Will it really work?

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.040
Yeah! Trust Grandma Si.

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.040
If Master has feelings for you,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.880
he'll think about you all day and night.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.680
He's coming.

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:03.470
But are we really doing this?

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.280
We've come so far.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:07.880
Hey.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.880
I told you to get baby powder.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.040
This is all there is,

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.680
or you'll get flour instead.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.360
Khem, give me your hand.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.560
Do it now.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.360
Cast the spell.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.000
Bring me a damp towel.

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.440
Uh...

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.440
Do you want to
wipe it off yourself, Master?

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.160
You do it.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.120
Sit here.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.520
What spell did you cast?

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.160
It was...

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.520
a spell from Grandma Si.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.220
What kind of spell?

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.160
Tell me what kind of spell it was.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.240
Uh...

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.630
Is there any way to help her?

01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:13.150
Jet, are you with Master?

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.630
Ramphueng's messing with us.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.189
There are 40 subjects of meditation.

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:19.740
But it takes time to master each one.

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:21.710
You came all the way here.

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:22.870
Is there a reason for your visit?

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.790
I need your help, Master.

01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:25.670
Oh...

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:27.109
You're Pong, right?

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:28.149
Master...

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:29.149
What about breakfast?

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.950
I'm not hungry.

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:33.590
I feel like
I've been making him uncomfortable.

01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:34.870
I think...

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.350
I won't bother Master anymore.
