[Shadow Love]

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.960
[Episode 35]

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.770
You made a round trip to Wuling Mountain,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710
created rubbings of some paintings

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.680
and delivered them
to Prince Annan's Mansion

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.710
within just two days?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.020
[Prince Annan's Mansion]

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.400
Since you can enter and exit
Prince Annan's Mansion with ease,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.079
why don't you just kill him?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.590
If he dies,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.920
Li Shuang will be heartbroken.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.460
You care about Li Shuang,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.180
so you'll be upset too.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.100
Then why should I hurt him?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680
Besides,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.630
his death won't necessarily

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.440
bring a lasting peace
between the two countries.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.310
Then why did you create those rubbings?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.360
You think he'd show mercy to Shuang

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.890
for the sake of
those flimsy sheets of paper?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.280
I had to try that,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680
since Li Shuang

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.000
refused to leave.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.680
If Jin'an can recall so much as
a tiny fragment of memory,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.590
then Li Shuang's noble intentions

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.250
may really make a difference.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.680
But with Jade Linglong
detached from his body

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.240
and all his memories gone,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.450
how is it possible to remind Jin'an

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.620
of the past with just a few paintings?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.600
Everything one has experienced

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680
must be somewhat etched in one's heart.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.280
Though Jade Linglong
once controlled his body,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.310
it never truly changed his heart.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.280
If this doesn't work,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.630
I'll rescue Li Shuang myself.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm here for all that may happen.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.930
Don't you worry.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.560
You used to stay

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.220
out of all worldly affairs.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.750
War,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.590
poverty,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.570
life and deathâ€”

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.400
you were never involved.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.890
What exactly turned you

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.210
into a man of compassion as you are now?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.610
I'm doing all this for you.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.840
Don't you see?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.960
You volunteered to help Li Shuang out,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.550
but she declined to leave with you.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.120
So, you chose to hole up
in this inn all day, sighing,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.720
with no idea of flexibility

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.870
or changing your approach.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.930
How foolish of you.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600
I lived in Wuling Mountain for years

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.450
in isolation from the world,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.650
so I didn't know much
about people's suffering.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.650
On that day

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.530
when Jin Wujian led an attack
against Wuling Mountain

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.330
and caused numerous casualties

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.760
in a real bloodbath,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.730
I suddenly realized

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.550
that war and slaughter

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.870
could only bring perpetual hatred

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.370
and grief.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.440
I just remembered one thing.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.960
Speaking of Jin Wujian,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.070
Shuang specifically asked me to tell you

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.600
that when she was confined,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.390
someone

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.030
gave her a bottle of a drug

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.350
named

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.370
Brain-Devouring Powder.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.630
That day, someone came

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.400
and gave me
a bottle of Brain-Devouring Power.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.710
Li Shuang...

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.610
didn't make a move?

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.800
Your Highness's spy
personally witnessed that.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.670
I thought she was smart,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.290
but as it turns out,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.880
she's a hopeless fool.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.360
If Prince Annan learns of
the Brain-Devouring Powder,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.950
he'll surely conduct
a thorough investigation.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.630
Your Highness,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.630
what should we do?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.610
Investigation?

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.490
Only if he lives long enough
to see that happen.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.090
When Li Wei's troops
arrive at the city gate,

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.890
Duan Aodeng
will go confront them by all means.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.680
Arrange archers now.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.570
Whether there will be a fight or a truce,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.600
he must

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.430
die on the battlefield.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.780
[Imperial Kitchen]

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.740
You said you'd take me somewhere nice.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.950
I thought we'd find clues
about the Brain-Devouring Powder.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.430
But instead,
we just sneaked into the imperial kitchen

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.480
for free food and drinks.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.210
You want some? It's delicious.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.190
I've told you all the clues I know.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.030
You already searched every corner

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.750
of this vast imperial palace,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.260
but couldn't find anything.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.330
I nearly starved to death.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.860
Jin Wujian is dead already.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.070
Why keep investigating

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.370
the Brain-Devouring Powder?

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.890
It is truly a rare drug.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.290
Now that it's involved,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.040
there must be something fishy going on.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.480
Although Jin Wujian is dead already,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.040
we still need to find
the mastermind behind all this,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.120
or Wuling Mountain

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.850
may get in danger in the future.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.230
Yummy.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.560
Are you crazy?

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.970
We're in the imperial palace of Yao State,

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.700
not the backyard of your house.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.750
Won't you be spotted

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.210
if you get out like this?

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.710
So what if I'm spotted?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.310
What can they do to me
with their lousy martial skills?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.570
You're able to escape,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.600
but I'm not.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.620
It'll be perfect if you get caught.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.560
That way, I can be rid of a burden.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.480
Who is it?

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.870
Who's in there?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.680
Who?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.120
Someone is here.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.760
Where is this person hiding?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.210
Let's go.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.720
Help! There are assassins!

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.980
Guards!

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.250
Catch the assassins!

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.850
Catch the assassins!

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.490
We're safe now.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.910
Who would've known

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.940
there's such a magnificent place

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.320
in the imperial palace of Yao State?

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.250
Everything here is made of gold.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.640
These wealthy nobles

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.510
should really improve
their imperial kitchen's cooking.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.710
The food is terrible.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.780
Even the popular restaurants
in Lucheng can do better.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.950
Is this also made of gold?

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.790
I saw you eat quite a lot.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.840
Plus,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.720
didn't you

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.080
steal much food as well?

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.010
You think everyone's like you?

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.330
You're basically subsisting on air.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.970
I get hungry easily.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.280
Of course I need to keep snacks at hand.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.530
I nearly starved to death just now.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.870
If I accidentally

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.340
faint from hunger,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.560
who will be there to help me?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.700
Careful!

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.480
I'm afraid this is a dead end.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.140
There's no way in. It's so dark here.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.750
All's brightened up.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.820
The light's too strong.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.910
Can you dim it?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.970
I'm fine with how it is now.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.100
Why is there a hidden chamber?

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.070
That's a human, right?

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.330
Can you put it out now?

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.150
It seems he's still alive.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.390
We just strayed into this place.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.720
We mean no harm.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.600
How may we address you, sir?

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.150
I think he's been tortured here
for a long time.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.790
Focus on our goal.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.430
We shouldn't waste time talking to him.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.210
Let's go.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.990
Are you silly or what?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.360
In this huge imperial palace,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.760
a secret chamber was built
under the ground

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.190
just to confine a dying man.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.930
Don't you find it suspicious?

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.480
Perhaps he has the clues

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.920
we're looking for.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.440
Do you understand human language?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.960
Have you heard of a poison

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.820
called Brain-Devouring Powder?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.600
You're locked up here

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.750
and badly tortured.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.010
Is all of this

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.970
Duan Aodeng's doing?

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.630
I'm afraid we won't

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.280
get an answer even if we keep asking.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.950
Maybe

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.310
he's speech-impaired.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.120
It's time we left.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.280
We'd better not cause trouble.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.090
Hold on...

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:38.910
Who was it?

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.900
General, I thought you were a true heroine

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.300
who'd know how to weigh things out best.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.670
That's why I wanted to save your life.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.600
But now,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.550
I'm deeply disappointed in you.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.400
Your plan was to make me commit a murder.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.060
Even if things had gone as you wished,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.030
you'd still take my life.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.530
Killing Prince Annan or not

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.680
wouldn't make a difference, would it?

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.220
You think he'd be grateful to you

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.150
for showing him mercy?

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.890
General, maybe you haven't heard

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.000
that your father Li Wei
has led an army to this very place.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.290
As we speak,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.630
he and your beloved man

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.640
are locked in mortal combat.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.570
Your Highness,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.130
those are our soldiers who got captured.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.150
Prince Annan,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.970
here we meet again.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.200
Li Wei,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.910
after hiding behind your daughter
for so long,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.620
you finally have the guts to face
the blood feud between us.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.920
Assassinations and sneak attacks
are indeed disgraceful acts.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.520
But for the safety of Taijin,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.680
I'd do everything in my power

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.510
and resort to any means necessary.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.120
If I were in the same situation again,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120
I'd repeat what I did without mercy.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.980
"Any means necessary"â€”of all the nerve!

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.730
Now that you said so,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.720
I'll avenge my brother

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.710
with my own hands.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.410
The Changfeng Army

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.800
is strictly disciplined.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.390
They'd never choose an individual
over the greater good.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.650
You think you can use me

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.890
to coerce my father into surrender?

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.390
Dream on.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.180
I aim for more than his surrender.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.140
Today,

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.069
neither Duan Aodeng nor Li Wei

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.900
can leave the battlefield alive.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.569
Soft-hearted lady,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.960
I'll have you see the devastating outcome

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.550
of your own merciful acts.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.099
Don't worry.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.090
I'll end your life in person afterwards,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.110
so you can reunite with them in hell.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.850
What are you waiting for?

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.160
Draw your sword out!

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.920
What stunt are you pulling now?

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.030
I came here

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.880
to seek peace

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.750
instead of new conflicts.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.310
Taijin and Yao State

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.830
were at war for decades.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.870
There were too many
killings and lost lives.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.680
During this year,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.270
stability has been gained

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.470
in the border area and among the people.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.350
This is a precious time of peace.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.270
In this case,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.440
why must we start a war again

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.700
and plunge the people into dire straits?

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.070
Prince Annan,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.890
if you agree to sheath the sword,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.160
I, Li Wei,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.000
will return
all the captured soldiers of Yao State

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.130
to you immediately.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.480
Our two countries

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.550
will be on good terms ever after.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.670
Think about it.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.680
If Yao State strengthens its army

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.240
and wages war again,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.930
it is the people of Yao State

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.710
who will suffer and agonize, right?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.860
You're responsible for my brother's death.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.680
Now, you're threatening me
with Yao soldiers.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.240
If I give you the satisfaction now,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.480
won't it be too easy for you?

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.380
I'm liable for your brother's misfortune.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.570
If my death can bring about

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.980
a reconciliation

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.440
between the two countries,
and peace and prosperity

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.400
to the people,

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.620
I will gladly lay down my life.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.430
Father!

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.700
Shuang,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.850
don't be afraid!

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.400
Why the rush?

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.420
This great show

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.100
has just begun.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.990
Shoot!

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.950
Father!

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.970
Prince Annan, what do you mean by this?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.210
You're openly protecting
the general of the enemy army.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.380
Are you planning for

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.880
a revolt?

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.240
Li Wei came here

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.030
to negotiate peace.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.740
For two countries at war,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.940
their envoys are not to be harmed!

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.700
Li Wei is unforgivable

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.160
for killing the late emperor!

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.310
By colluding with Taijin

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.710
and committing treason,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.490
Duan Aodeng has dishonored
the late emperor.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.440
Execute him now!

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.980
Father!

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.830
Father!

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.550
Father!

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.270
Shoot them to death!

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.200
Father!

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.960
It's no secret to me

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.820
that you're Duan Aodeng's woman.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.020
I don't care if you two are
putting on an act for me today,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.940
or if you've truly broken up.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.480
What I'm sure is that you care about him

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.980
and you can't bring yourself to kill him.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.880
You'll have to pay a price

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.880
for your affection.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.880
Why did you...

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.030
For the people of Taijin and Yao State,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.160
I'm ready to forfeit my life.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.590
Prince Annan,

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.870
the blood feud between us

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.270
is finally...

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.680
ended today.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.830
Open your eyes and watch.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.480
All the deaths down there today

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.980
are caused by you.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.030
I only beg you...

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.860
to spare Shuang's life,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.720
now that mine is to be taken.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.720
Let her

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.440
leave...

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.920
here

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.820
safely.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.990
Father!

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.640
Father!

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.550
Shoot!

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.440
Keep up!

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:56.690
Let go of me!

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.070
I'll have all of you torn into pieces!

00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.540
Let...

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.400
Let go of me!

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.490
This woman disregarded military discipline

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.220
and killed soldiers of our own.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.000
She'll be kept in the military prison

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.720
and punished
according to the military law.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.590
Back off!

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.040
I am the Empress Dowager,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.480
the real sovereign of Yao State.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.350
Prince Annan, you're just a nobody.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.350
How dare you order to
punish meâ€”your superior?

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.700
You've known me for many years.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.770
I'm sure you're aware of my arrogance.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.610
I'll decisively execute those

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.280
who have committed capital offenses,

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.430
despite all hindrances.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:35.920
Li Wei...

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.680
Li Wei caused the late emperor's death.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.440
Revenge was justified,
as it linked to the nation's dignity.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.700
Did I do anything wrong

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.310
by ordering to shoot him?

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.830
And you have the gall
to mention my brother.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.720
If you hadn't plotted a murder

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.360
and taken my brother out of the palace,

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.420
he wouldn't have been assassinated.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.550
In the interests of
the now emperor and the court,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.010
I meant to spare your life.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.910
Little did I expect you
to be blinded by greed

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.390
at the nadir of depravity.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.880
Li Wei came alone

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.070
to seek peace.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.310
Behind him stood

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.370
the captured soldiers of our army,

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.240
who shed blood for our country.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.270
They came back alive from Taijin

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.470
only to be killed by their compatriots.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.350
Were you really trying to kill Li Wei,

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.480
or to take that opportunity

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.230
to eliminate your political opponents?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.750
You can't prove that.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.840
This is pure slander
and blatant defiance against sovereignty.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.890
I personally witnessed what you did.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.170
The Brain-Devouring Powder
you gave to Li Shuang

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.440
is also proof.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.570
Prince Annan, what's your relationship

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.040
with this female general?

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.550
When Li Shuang was in captivity,

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.550
you visited her abode multiple times

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.230
to dine and play the qin

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.270
with her.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.160
You even

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.270
stayed there overnight.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.750
You're a traitor colluding with

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.440
the female general of the enemy country.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.720
Now, you're even framing me
with a random bottle of poison.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.950
You've sinned against Yao State.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.000
Being powerless and alone,

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.840
I knew I couldn't fight you off,

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.270
so I ordered to shoot you
on the battlefield.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.680
How was I wrong?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.120
Why are you laughing?

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.270
Because

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.370
I'm surprised I can live to see

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.120
such intense infighting

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.590
in the imperial court of Yao State.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.100
Trying to protect him,
aren't you, General?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.440
Months ago,

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.900
Yao State and Taijin
had a battle in Lucheng.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.550
Prince Annan barged into
our own military camp alone

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.030
to slaughter soldiers

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.770
and slay several generals.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.850
That was why the Changfeng Army
stayed unscathed.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.090
General Li,

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.560
have you already forgotten it?

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:49.560
That's right.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.070
The man standing right in front of you now

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.640
is

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.160
exactly the terrifying man in black.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.110
What?

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.310
The man in black?

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.270
How can that be possible?

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.640
Uncanny.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.190
If it really was him...

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.700
Despicable rebel,

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.580
how dare you impudently and openly

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.440
put me on trial?

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:41.800
Impossible!

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.680
Prince Annan would never
betray our country!

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.440
Yes.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.030
But the then reports from the battlefield

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.400
described the man in black

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.590
as an intrepid warriorâ€”

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.880
I assume in today's world,

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.080
only Prince Annan can be a match for him.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.760
When the late emperor passed away,

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.880
we all thought you suddenly died

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.140
from excessive grief.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.720
But as it turns out,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.850
you just faked your own death and fled.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.660
Today,
in the presence of all the officials,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.160
do you dare to say

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.480
where you went

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.920
and what you did

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.160
in the year you vanished?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.460
The man in black...

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.610
was me.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.530
But I lost control of my body
at that time

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.410
and completely forgot
my identity as Prince Annan.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.910
Now that Prince Annan
has confessed candidly,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.270
today,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.790
in the name of the Empress Dowager,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.310
I'll uphold justice for all.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.440
Guards,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.680
take Prince Annan down.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.270
Put him in the Imperial Prison

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.870
for an impending execution.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.030
Li Shuang, the female general of Taijin,

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.290
shall be executed too.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.510
Everyone has to

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.360
pay the price for what they've done.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.040
I'll take full responsibility

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.720
for everything I've done.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.600
But before I'm punished,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.640
I must rid the nation of this vile woman
who harmed the late emperor

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.720
and killed our countrymen.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.160
Even an upcoming death

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.660
can't stop you
from spewing false allegations.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.350
Is there any proof of

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:36.450
your accusations?

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.350
What are you dawdling for?

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.350
Take him down!

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.790
I am living proof.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.740
Ze?

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.060
Greetings

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640
to Your Majesty.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.880
Greetings to Your Majesty!

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.350
Long live Your Majesty!

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.160
Is this a rebellion?

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.920
Who are you kneeling to?

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.920
Only my son Yu
is the Emperor of Yao State!

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920
Get up, all of you!

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.060
Get up!

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.400
Get up!

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.240
Honey,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.320
you waited a long time

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.280
for this day, didn't you?

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.200
That day,

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.630
you lied about Aodeng being in danger
and lured me out of the palace.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.570
You attempted to gain control of me
through dark magic.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.780
When Aodeng risked his life to save mine,

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.930
he fell victim to your evil magic.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.550
In the past year,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.460
you kept conspiring with villains
to jeopardize him.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.590
Today, you venomously
aimed to kill him again.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.790
You already took the reign of Yao State.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.590
Why did you have to persecute him?

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.830
Because I hated him.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.110
Though we had got married,

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.230
he still only saw my sister as your wife.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.690
What about me?

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.800
Then, I killed my sister,

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:14.480
cast the Love-Binding Curse on you

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.080
and finally gave birth to Yu.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.969
I thought
though I might not have your heart,

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.190
at least my son Yu
would be the ruler of Yao State.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.409
But one day,
as I passed by the imperial study,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.000
I overheard you

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.850
talking about
giving the throne to Duan Aodeng.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:35.639
Why?

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.030
Yu is your own son.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.110
Why can't you accept him?

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.760
The one Ze can't accept

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.810
is you.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.199
He who stands in my way

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.320
must die.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.670
Your father's body

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.850
has been sent back to the city.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.840
You can go bid him farewell now.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.590
I didn't kill him,

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.880
yet he died because of me.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:55.510
Your father

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.320
saved my life.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.240
In the future,

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.550
if you want blood for blood,

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.810
I won't try to get away.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.890
He exchanged his own life

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.140
for a reconciliation
between our two countries.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.360
Unjustifiable bloodshed and sacrifices

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.110
are what he would hate to see.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.380
Father,

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.670
in all these years,

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.570
I always referred to you
as "Grand General,"

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.530
and rarely called you "Father."

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:16.710
But in my heart,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.520
I truly envied Ting

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.610
having a close father-child bond

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.880
with you without worries.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.880
Although I bear the family name of Li,

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.320
I'm not really related to you by blood.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.780
I feared that I wasn't qualified.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.480
I lacked courage.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.590
During these years,

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.590
I thought

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.480
I could repay you for raising me

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.440
by fighting enemies

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.230
bravely on the battlefield.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.880
You treated me

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.630
as your own daughter the entire time,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.070
but I was so opinionated

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.000
that I chose to keep
a meaningless distance from you

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.280
and let all the beautiful moments

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.420
slip away.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.920
I never regretted

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.590
being a female general

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.970
and fighting on the battlefield.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.070
But now I do regret

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.360
not being a good enough daughter to you.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.030
If there is a next life,

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.320
I hope
you'll lead a peaceful and joyful life.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.520
â™ª Before my eyes â™ª

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.700
â™ª Your lines are still clear â™ª

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.590
â™ª Scattered about, they sigh â™ª

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.470
First, I wish you good health,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.710
â™ª Reflecting moments etched deep inside â™ª

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.590
longevity,

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.510
â™ª Life's long journey drifts by â™ª

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.290
and eternal happiness.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:03.360
â™ª How can we hope
to return to days gone by? â™ª

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.770
â™ª In a moment of thought â™ª

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:08.350
â™ª Every thread of longing grows wild â™ª

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.510
â™ª Hesitant to brush aside â™ª

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.000
â™ª I'm afraid your face will be blurred â™ª

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.120
Second, I wish you every success,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.410
â™ª For all the fervor â™ª

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:16.840
â™ª And reluctance tied to these memories,
our ways have parted â™ª

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.230
safety in battles

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.170
and lasting joy.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.160
â™ª All I ask â™ª

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.410
â™ª One promise,
I will follow without hesitation â™ª

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.720
â™ª All I pursue â™ª

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.160
â™ª Joys and sorrows â™ª

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:32.140
â™ª Stake my whole life â™ª

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.760
â™ª On this â™ª

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.930
Third, I wish you to be freed of worries,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.280
â™ª Stepping on the frost â™ª

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:38.440
