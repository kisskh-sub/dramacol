00:01:23.712 --> 00:01:25.319
(Kediaman Huo)

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.079
Why do you get more and more scared as you get older?

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.239
Moreover,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.359
That snotty kid is your own choice.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:32.319
Now?

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.599
He's already stepped over your head.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.000
You just stay at home,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.239
not daring to speak at all.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.719
I told you,

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.280
You should
n't have chosen him in the first place.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.799
If not him, then who would you choose?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.040
Choose King Guangling?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.159
Do you think the gift
from King Guangling is easy to accept?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.359
Just for that small profit,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.280
later

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.560
the entire Huo Family will be dragged down by you.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.519
A woman's narrow-minded view.

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:57.040
Hey!

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.439
Then, try to give me
the view of a real man.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.000
Stop!

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.680
Every time we fight,
you just leave.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.000
Is this how you solve problems?

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.759
Besides, you don't trust
that Kirin.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.199
Why spend all day searching for that mantra?

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.280
I did it
to ask for your safety.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.280
It made me, who previously didn't believe it,
now have to believe it.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.439
If I really am gone,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.439
The Huo family will definitely be wiped out.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.639
Report!

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.520
The four Generals have arrived.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.199
Hmm.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.319
Tuan Huo.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.319
Generals, what's the matter?

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.800
Mr. Huo, the situation in the government
is in chaos now.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.400
We officials are very nervous.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.800
If you disagree even a little,
you'll immediately get scolded.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.840
One by one they
were appointed as officials.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.680
In front of us, they were so arrogant.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.280
Sir.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.599
If you don't act soon...

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.080
Enough.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000
The emperor was still young.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.360
He also just ascended the throne.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.039
Not yet understanding palace etiquette.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.319
Sometimes act as you please.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.039
That's only natural.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.639
Our duty as ministers
is to accompany him well.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.520
Regarding the people below,

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.639
you just handle it according to the rules.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.280
Good.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.520
May the Emperor live long.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.919
Stand.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.280
Thank you, Emperor.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.080
Why the Commander-in-Chief?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.280
not come?

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.000
Report, Emperor.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.960
Mr. Huo is not feeling well.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.879
He specifically
requested permission from the Emperor.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.039
According to,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.199
he was just tired.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.080
If so,
there is no need to come again.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.439
Report, Emperor.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.560
(Prime Minister, Yang Chang)
Mr. Huo presides over military affairs.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.360
Please, the Emperor,
immediately appoint a replacement.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.160
Well then, I think

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:18.959
What if...

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.480
Emperor.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.839
Military affairs are a big deal.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.560
When the Commander-in-Chief is not present,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.079
according to custom

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.959
should be the General of the Agile Cavalry,
the General of the War Chariots,

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.920
and the other generals
discussed together.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.920
We all

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.959
willing to help
ease the Emperor's burden.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.279
Military affairs need not
bother General Zhang.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.560
I have my own decision.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:41.160
I took courage.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.079
Military affairs
are not government affairs.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.839
If the Emperor continues to assign
new generals to manage the military,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.120
it was feared that the troops would be in disarray.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:50.879
In my opinion,

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:52.160
that's inappropriate.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.199
Then, military affairs

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.560
I will

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.160
handle it yourself.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.720
Emperor.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
Military affairs include

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.000
defense placement,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.720
preparation,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.360
training,

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.160
and care.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.360
So heavy,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.000
Is the Emperor really
going to bear it alone?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.800
What do you mean?

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:12.680
Emperor.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.480
Ouch.

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:14.879
Dear Generals,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.680
This military matter is a big problem.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.879
I think we should
wait for Mr. Huo to recover.

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.120
we just discussed

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.720
and make decisions.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.160
It won't be too late, right?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.839
Isn't that so?

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:26.519
How?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.000
Mr. Huo is not there.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.199
Can't I even
decide on military matters?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.319
This...

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.279
Emperor.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.480
Military affairs
were indeed Mr. Huo's duty.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.160
We also see the Emperor
busy with government affairs.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.040
and want to do the tasks
that are our part.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.959
This has also become a habit.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.040
However, since the Emperor
already had his own plans,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.680
I think we are of no use anymore.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.959
I beg to resign
to return to my hometown.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.600
I beg your leave.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.959
I also ask to resign.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.839
The Generals.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.639
All Generals.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.800
Emperor.

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.639
These four generals shouldered
the heavy responsibility of guarding Chang'an.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.279
They have a very good understanding of the conditions of troops
from various regions.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.759
In my opinion, handing over

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.959
military affairs to them
is the most appropriate step.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.000
All Generals.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.079
Mr. Huo is not feeling well.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.600
You guys are this fast

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.519
resigned to go home.

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.879
Wouldn't this
disappoint Mr. Huo's trust?

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:35.680
Then,
do as Mr. Yan suggests.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.199
Good.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.279
(Kediaman Raja Changyi, Chang'an)

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.480
Meeting this morning

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.879
you were not there.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.360
A group of generals
conspired against me.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.040
I as the Emperor,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.319
do you have no right
to decide at all?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.920
In the end, I still had to
ask Huo Guang.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.839
Even though today he wasn't even present.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.399
Look.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.000
Everything has been decided.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.680
Where do I have room to refuse?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.120
I told you,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.439
in name you are indeed an emperor.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.240
However, in fact they
were all Huo Guang's men.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.040
You have to be patient.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.399
Outrageous!

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.600
Absolutely outrageous!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.839
Emperor.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.439
It's bad, Emperor.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.360
What happened?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.759
Our brothers from Changyi
were beaten by Huo Yu.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.560
What?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.399
What caused it?

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:29.399
Today General Huo Yu
suddenly inspected the formation of the line.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.199
Our brothers' formation is not good.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.800
He wanted to punish the commander who led,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.959
then beat him.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.639
Why
don't you usually practice every day?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.000
The soldiers only wanted
to obey the Huo Family.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:41.600
Our brothers
can't control them at all.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160
During formation practice,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.839
they deliberately do whatever they want.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.759
Okay.

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:48.439
I will remove Huo Yu from office now!

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.399
Wait!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.800
His reasons are valid.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.439
If you immediately remove it

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.040
his position,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.839
how do people respond?

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.120
Brother Heng.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.560
They are clearly oppressing us.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.240
Today is the physical punishment of brother,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.879
How about tomorrow?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.399
What if you get killed?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.600
Tomorrow's business, talk tomorrow.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.000
Keep waiting for the opportunity.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.600
What?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.920
Waiting, waiting,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.680
wait until we have a plan
and help.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.560
Why wait?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.000
Act now.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.160
If it fails,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.199
then the prediction will come true.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.439
If we don't act,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.079
The brothers were still punished.

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:25.879
There is danger.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.920
Didn't you say my actions
were according to prophecy?

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.679
This means Huo Guang has started
targeting us.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.360
So, whether we act or not,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.559
In the end, Changyi's brothers
will die.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960
You will die too.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.240
Then why not try your hardest?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.200
Are you sure?

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:53.960
Of course.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.000
It's been 27 days since receiving the seal,

00:08:58.639 --> 00:08:59.639
messengers came one after another,

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.960
carry orders to various agencies.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:04.799
Total 1,127 matters.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.519
Acting carelessly, endangering the country.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.000
It's a good thing you remember this long prophecy.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.559
I used to help people study.

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:18.600
Every day must memorize.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.120
Follow what you say.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.600
Let's make a bet.

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:25.799
Make plans according to destiny.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.639
So you agree?

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.240
Huo Guang would definitely take steps
to depose the Emperor.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:35.000
We must act first.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.759
In that case...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.559
In the name of accusing the Emperor of his abdication,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.080
punish him for disloyalty.

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:42.360
Now,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.519
you just do these things,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.559
and done.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.039
It's not even a thousand or so.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.639
That's enough, no need to overdo it.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.840
Is there anyone who in a day

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.200
don't eat don't sleep,

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:56.720
can commit 40 crimes?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.159
If you want to make an accusation,

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.519
there must be a reason.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:04.919
All of this is done by yourself.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.080
It seems,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.879
This is exactly what I did.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.200
Why can't Mr. Gong know?

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:15.960
This is a different thing.

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:18.519
As long as all this is over,

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:20.879
on the 27th day after your coronation,

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.720
we can definitely hunt outside the city.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.000
At that time,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.600
we can exchange troops.

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.399
I will read it.

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:38.840
You guys write,

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:40.320
you spread it.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.240
Good.

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:45.159
First decree.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:47.080
The emperor who received the mandate of heaven,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.120
learned officials

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:50.960
who want to serve and follow me,

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.519
will surely be glorified.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:54.240
Second decree.

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:58.120
The emperor wanted to recruit
talented people without limits.

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:02.200
However, it is necessary to fire
useless employees for the sake of clean government.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:05.039
Third decree.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:09.200
Reduce excessive taxes
to ease the burden on the people.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.279
Forgive everyone
and start a new era.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:13.679
Fourth decree.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.240
The emperor who received the mandate of heaven,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.039
conferring the title of Queen Mother

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.320
for mother

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.919
as a form of devotion.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.039
Fifth decree.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.360
The emperor who received the mandate of heaven,

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.200
remembering the lineage of the grandmother
of the Li clan,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.759
Previously, they suffered injustice, now
they are specifically given the restoration of their good name.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:31.960
Awarded territory
in honor of his virtues.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.519
The sixth decree.
The emperor who received the mandate of heaven,

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.840
respectfully remembering the virtues
of the late Father Emperor Liu Bo,

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.639
specifically issued information
so that the spirit board

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:40.720
placed in the ancestral shrine.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.480
Together with the ancestors, receiving offerings.

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:49.320
The seventh decree.
The emperor who received the mandate of heaven,

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:51.679
wish to change the symbol system,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.039
specifically calling for the yellow banner

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.639
to show the new rules.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.960
(A day passes,)

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.600
(Liu He apparently issued
more than 50 decrees.)

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.360
(Looking at the decree bearer...)

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.039
Who is there?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:02.799
Who is there?

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:04.080
(Continue to spread his decree down,)

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.399
(the rumors among the officials are getting worse,)

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:09.240
(but Liu He didn't care at all)

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.840
(and continue to do as
written in the destiny of heaven.)

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.600
(As if everything is starting to merge
with the destiny of the sky.)

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.159
Brothers, come with me

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:26.639
towards Chang'an.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.440
I will keep my promise.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.360
Enjoy luxury together.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.039
Emperor,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.159
now brothers and sisters

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:39.200
truly enjoying
untold luxury.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.679
Now the Emperor

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.159
has become the supreme ruler.

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:48.279
Palace affairs

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.000
held by Commander-in-Chief Huo.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.600
If the Emperor wants great success,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.000
realize ambitions,

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.360
must remove Commander-in-Chief Huo.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.919
Mr. Huo is a veteran
of three reigns,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720
his services are extraordinary.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.840
Don't talk carelessly.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.679
Emperor.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:08.080
Hesitation will only lead to disaster.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.320
I have my own considerations.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.159
Come on, let's drink together!

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.000
Drink!

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.360
Cheers!

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.960
Zhang Sheng.

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.080
Li Qi.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.279
Tuan Zhang.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.840
Tuan Li.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.200
The girl of choice for you,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.679
does it suit your taste?

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:08.000
Thank you in advance, Emperor.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.759
If you are not satisfied, my imperial seal
is there.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320
If still not satisfied,

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.600
You can also take
this Imperial Seal.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.480
How about being Emperor
for two days?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.399
Hahaha.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.000
Okay.

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.519
Drink for me!

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.679
Drink!

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.240
Emperor.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.000
This petition was entrusted to Mr. Gong,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.200
permission has not been granted.

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.480
Allow.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.039
Okay.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.639
Good.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.960
Good.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.519
It's finished.

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.759
There are no more decrees
I need to stamp.

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.200
- Hahaha.
- Right.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.039
So this final decree

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.000
is for you.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:04.960
Okay.

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:11.720
Emperor.

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:22.720
This...

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.960
Destined by the sky,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.320
Long life and prosperity.

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:48.600
I

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.639
is your sky.
