00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.930
[Episode 38]

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.680
Assassin!

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.420
Protect His Majesty!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.620
Protect His Majesty.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.080
Who are you?

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.310
How dare you disrupt
the funeral procession

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.510
of Taijin's Empress?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.040
How can my beloved wife

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.070
enter your imperial mausoleum?

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.590
I issued the military order

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.850
forbidding you to eat.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.920
Eat this candy secretly.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.840
Eat it secretly.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.410
Let's go home.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.750
Your Majesty set this trap

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.360
just to lure Duan Aodeng out

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.240
to kill him.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.830
Given the current situation,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.000
he must've regained his powers.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.180
Without a clever strategy,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.710
he's impossible to defeat.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.830
The deceased feels no pain.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.560
Please ease your heart, Your Majesty.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.159

Do you think you can

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.750
escape unscathed after killing me?

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.050
Killing you will be a cakewalk.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.930
If you still want to protect Taijin,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.130
don't stand in my way.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.360
As an emperor,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.220
I can't take my own life lightly.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.000
But if I were to die by your hand today,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.230
I'd be glad to reunite with Shuang

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.550
in the afterlife.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.900
You don't deserve that.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.400
Shuang devoted her entire life to Taijin.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.860
You not only watched her

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.740
being forced to death,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.600
but you even

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600
used her corpse as bait

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.560
to lure me out.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.910
I'm the ruler of a nation.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.890
Li Shuang is the posthumously honored
empress of Taijin.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.220
As the mother figure of the empire,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.390
in life, she fought enemies
in the battlefield,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.720
and in death, she helps Taijin

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.850
eliminate threats.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.650
What's wrong with that?

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.360
I should've never
let her return to Taijin.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.390
You failed to protect her—

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.549
If you truly loved her,

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.410
why'd it fall to me to protect her?

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.610
You betrayed her.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.080
Now you want to take her away again.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.890
Duan Aodeng.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.200
Don't you think you're being too greedy?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.600
However, I didn't expect

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.990
that you'd go to such lengths

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.720
to restore the Jade Linglong.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.570
I accept my defeat.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.910
I only hope

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.270
that after my death,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.410
you won't use the Jade Linglong's power
to wage war.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.740
Give the people of Taijin

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.390
peace and tranquility.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.350
I'm no longer Prince Annan of Yao State.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.670
Worldly affairs are

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.400
no longer my concern.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.510
I didn't

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.720
come here to kill you.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.030
Killing you

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.360
would only breed more hatred.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.930
I just want to take Shuang home.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.960
All my flesh and blood

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.730
have been hunted down and killed by me.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.720
Even if you kill me,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.790
except for Shuang,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.480
no one would avenge me.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.260
There are also your people of Taijin.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.830
Since you took the throne,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.950
you've led the people and nation

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.880
with compassion and diplomacy.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.220
You're a good emperor.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.950
The peace between our two states

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.690
was bought with Shuang's life.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.480
You owe it to her to safeguard it.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.200
You love her more

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.960
than I imagined.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.350
Your Majesty.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.440
This Dream Powder is

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.010
the most precious secret drug
in the palace.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.440
It's the only one in the world,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.150
an heirloom

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.440
for emergencies.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.120
Are you really sure

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.480
you want to use it on General Li?

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.630
Everyone in Taijin

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.910
wants her dead.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.290
But I won't allow it.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.390
In my lifetime,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.060
I owe her too much.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.910
I can only use this

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.080
to let her live on.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.800
The Dream Powder

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.120
stops one's breathing,

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.950
making them appear dead.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.960
Once you take this pill,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.510
you'll awaken

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.400
in 3 days.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.560
Since Shuang is still alive,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.610
why did you set up this trap?

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480
To lure you out.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.720
You renounced your title as Prince Annan.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.850
I already knew that.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.440
So,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.180
I decided to take a gamble,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.450
betting that you still love Shuang deeply

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.870
and would do anything to save her.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.900
What I carry on my shoulders is

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.450
the weight of the empire

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.380
and all its people.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.320
I can't love her alone.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.200
But you can.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.010
Gambling with your life,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.830
aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.420
This journey

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.380
has been perilous.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.720
My hands are stained
with the blood of many,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.440
yet I've never felt indebted to anyone,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.610
except for Shuang.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.960
I owe her too much.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.550
If I were to die for her,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.210
I'd have no regrets.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.360
From now on,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.210
Prince Annan no longer exists,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.120
nor does General Li.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.550
May Taijin and Yao

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
remain allies

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.030
forever.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.780
[Wuling]

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.360
If you keep refusing

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.620
food, water, and rest,

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.310
I'm afraid you'll collapse

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.960
before Shuang wakes up.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.560
It's already the third day.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.480
Why hasn't she awakened?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.150
Three days is just an estimate.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.480
How drugs work is contingent on

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.360
your constitution,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.550
which varies.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.320
Mo Yin said

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.870
it's normal to last for five to ten days.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.480
There's no need to be so anxious.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.270
Is it five days

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.320
or ten days?

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.550
So what if you know the exact time?

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.720
When Shuang wakes up

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.520
and sees you looking half-dead,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.550
she might become so upset

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.720
that she faints again.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.980
After all you've done,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.880
are you still

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.160
going to make her suffer for nothing?

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:38.840
How'd it go?

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.330
He finally ate something.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.870
That's good.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.080
I added

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.840
calming medicine to his porridge

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.370
so he could rest for a while,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.630
lest he

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.320
completely ruins his health.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.910
Can you guarantee

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440
Shuang will

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.250
wake up again?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.200
Actually, I'm not that anxious.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.349
I can wait for you.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.270
Let alone a few days,

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.570
even if it takes years,

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.550
decades,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.780
or even centuries,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.380
I'll wait for you forever.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.030
Anyway, you are

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.760
stuck with me in this lifetime.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.000
Mo Yin thought I couldn't leave you

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.230
because the Jade Linglong had

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.440
chosen its master.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.120
But he doesn't know that

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.880
even the rarest spiritual entities

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.100
lack the ability to love.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.480
What truly loves you

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.000
is me...

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.480
and my heart.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.480
So,

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.960
whether I remove the Jade Linglong

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.310
or lose my memory,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.830
or whether I am Jin'an or Duan Aodeng,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.160
no matter how many times we start over,

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.310
I'll irresistibly fall in love with you

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.750
time and again.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.060
Uncontrollably...

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.030
I'll fall for you all over again.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.760
Even in the worst case

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.560
where you really

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.670
never wake up in this lifetime,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.130
I'm not afraid.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.200
Because we agreed

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.590
to be born together

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.270
and to die together.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.590

Shuang.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.790
Who are you?

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.070
You...

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.260
don't remember me?

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.080
Why am I here?

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.680
Did you just

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.650
call me Shuang?

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.140
Is that my name?

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:01.990
Don't come near me!

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.440
Stay right there.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.310
Why am I here?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.850
What's your relationship with me?

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.830
Answer me!

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.720
Who are you?

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.280
It's okay.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.590
When I forgot everything,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.070
you suffered alone.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.590
Now I guess it's my turn.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.930
As long as you're safe and healthy,

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.210
I'll be whoever

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.570
you want me to be.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.400
What nonsense

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.710
are you talking about?

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.920
What's your

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.750
relationship with me?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.160
I am your—

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.750
Just stay put

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.920
and talk!

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.880
I am your...

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.750
Your...

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.350
I get it now.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.720
You're a thug!

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.160
A man and woman alone

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.440
in this remote wilderness—

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.900
you must've kidnapped me!

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.870
How's this a remote wilderness?

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.090
Besides,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.250
do I really look like a thug?

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.590
I'll go to you.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:21.690
Don't you move.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.790
Stay still.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.470
Well,

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.020
you're quite handsome.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.720
I doubt you're a bad guy.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.360
Are you the fox spirit

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.400
who gave your heart to me,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.350
a hunter who fell off a cliff?

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.160
You have no memory of your past,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.870
but you remember the stories

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.960
in the biographies quite well.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.560
Do you read biographies too?

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.400
Then do you know

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.110
when the main characters

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.550
are the happiest

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.070
in those stories?

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.200
When?

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.550
When

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.200
it's a false alarm

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.850
and when they find what they've lost.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.510
Today,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.620
you've experienced both.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.550
By the Mandate of Heaven,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.160
the Emperor decrees:

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.310
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]
[Three months later]

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.480
Since our nation and Yao State

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.880
have formed an alliance,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.590
we're fortunate to have peace

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.110
throughout the land.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240
All weapons

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.440
may now be sheathed and silenced.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.550
Taxes and labor duties will be reduced

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.920
nationwide,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.640
to give relief to the people.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.070
Starting today,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.480
these policies shall be

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.240
implemented in all regions

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.110
and evaluated accordingly.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.030
His Majesty is wise and enlightened!

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.910
[I will certainly fulfill]

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.880
[everything we once hoped for together.]

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.190
[I won't fail the world,]

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:51.830
[nor will I fail you.]

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.000
I heard that

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.660
Taijin and Yao State have
signed a peace treaty.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.040
All the people

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.160
can finally live in peace.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.550
Before they left,

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.890
I checked Jin'an's pulse.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.880
He's no different from
ordinary people now.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.480
According to ancient texts,

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.590
his shadow puppet and blood master
have merged.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.200
He is now his own master,

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.960
which means

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.220
the Jade Linglong will

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.800
only have health-strengthening effects.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.680
Which ancient text?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.360
I've never come across that.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.310
That's because your studies are lacking.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.570
Go look it up yourself.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.640
Before, you went through so much trouble

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.120
to get that Jade Linglong.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.470
Why aren't you

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.850
in a hurry to get it back from Jin'an now?

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.750
I originally thought

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.510
the shadow puppet was just an emotionless

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.590
killing machine.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.510
But Jin'an's heart is

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.110
full of love

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.150
and kindness.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.040
After getting to know him,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.860
my view of the Jade Linglong
has completely changed.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.240
Besides, the Jade Linglong has chosen him.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.270
It'd be near impossible for anyone else

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.640
to take it and use it.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.160
Leaving it with him

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.540
wouldn't hurt.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.200
But, Master Mo,

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.840
you're still generous,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.480
willing to give away

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.510
such a treasure

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.440
to someone else.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.270
What are you saying?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960
I have

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.220
always been generous.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.590
If you're that generous,

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:31.880
why don't you

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.270
give me this Wuling Mountain

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.250
filled with treasures?

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:46.830
If you like it,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.640
it's yours.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.630
Everyone in Wuling Mountain

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.050
treats you as
the lady of the house anyway.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.000
It would make

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.270
no difference.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.880
Since the Master has spoken,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.400
then my position

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.290
should be made official.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.790
Well, you're getting on in years,

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.880

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.160
I guess I shall deign to

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.640
compromise and be your missus.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.750
You...

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.110
As a young lady,

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.880
how could you speak so boldly

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.940

I'm extraordinarily good-looking.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.240
Who's compromising is debatable.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.010

♪ To the end of the world ♪

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.880
Two.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.190
Drink some water.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.670
Three.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.000
Four!

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.540
Is it sweet?

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.670
One more.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.020
Here.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.280
Living an easy life

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.070
being pampered is nice.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.440
Why was I

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.640
so stubborn before,

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:48.650
not knowing how to enjoy life?

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.800
As long as you're happy.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.670
Fan harder.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.000
Alright,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.150
that's enough

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.840
for today.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.510
Thank you, Master.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:59.920
I've barely taught you anything.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.320
I'm no master.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:02.440
Then what should

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.630
we call you?

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.550
If not Master...

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.350
Call me Uncle.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:13.550
See?

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.510
I told you they were a couple.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.480
Come on, let's go play.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.680
Help needed!

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.150
Please help, you two!

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.400
We're out of firewood.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.130
Can you watch

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.580
these two little ones?

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.430
Sure, leave them to us. Go ahead.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.080
Have fun.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.250
Be careful on your way.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:29.960
Alright!

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.590
Are you hot?

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.320
Don't run around!

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:35.920
Don't run!

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:36.960
There's a ball there too!

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.690
Don't fight!

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.090
I'll get you another ball.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.110
Don't bump into others!

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.960
Be careful.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.200
You'll fall.
Don't climb on the dining table.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.010
Don't pluck the flowers!

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.060
Are you hot?

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:00.800
It's really not easy

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.760
to watch kids.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360
I think it's nice.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.000
With so many kids, it's so lively

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.880
and fun.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.000
Don't run too fast!

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.030
It is fun.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.630
Just a bit tiring.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.630
Why don't you

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.840
help me recharge?

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.480
How?

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.920
Give me a kiss.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.440
No way.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.390
They're all watching.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.150
They're busy playing.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.800
Just one kiss.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800
Just a quick peck.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.070
It'll be a bad influence on the kids! No!

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.710
Just a peck.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.280
No.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.080
We've been together for so long.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.110
They are looking!

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.110
They're not!

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.710
What do you mean?
Look, so many

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:37.110
-pairs of eyes!
-Then...

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:37.800
Let's do this.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.400
I'll block their view.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.150
Kiss me secretly.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.840
Secretly.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.480
No. No way.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.230
They can't see us.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.880
Then I'll kiss you.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.320
No, that won't work either.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.580
Fine, no kissing then.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.890
Finally got them all settled.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.930
Taking care of kids is really not easy.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.430
What's wrong?

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.230
I was thinking...

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.250
The kids have someone to soothe them.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.850
Why doesn't anyone soothe me?

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.120
Are the children

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.360
all asleep?

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.190
Looks like they are.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.070
Shuang.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:08.920
Shuang!

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:09.960
What?

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.510
Can you...

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.920
soothe me again?

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.510
Why?

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:16.160
Ouyang!

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.990
You two...

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.740
You're back! Just in time!

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.020
Perfect timing.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.470
The kids are all asleep.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.690
They're yours now.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.270
Are you leaving already?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.510
Wait.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.480
Stay a few more days.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.320
You don't come often.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:27.800
We have

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.270
troubled you enough.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.780
Until next time.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.030
But...

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.430
Let's go.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.760
The kids will miss you!

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.110
What about dinner?

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.670
No thanks!

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.800
Save it for the kids!

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.080
What's the rush?

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.590
Did they scare you that much?

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.590
Let's go quickly.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.880
Once those little monsters wake up,

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.680
all hell will break loose again.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.400
I remember someone

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.670
bragging so confidently

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.800
that watching kids for a while

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.860
will be a cakewalk.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.510
Yes, the kids are cute,

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.430
but they're a bit too energetic.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.550
I can't handle it.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.380
More importantly,

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.460
I really want us

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.800
