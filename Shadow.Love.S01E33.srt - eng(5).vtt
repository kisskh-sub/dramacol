[Shadow Love]

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.979
[Episode 33]

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.410
Prince Annan.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.070
Have someone prepare a meat dish

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.950
and send it over quickly.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.300
Yes.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.590
Have you kept…

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.470
your promises to me?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.820
In my prison camp,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.790
even without you asking,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.050
food and medicine

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.090
are well provided.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.960
As for the 2 innocent soldiers
who were killed,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.210
I've ordered proper burials for them.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.140
These are their identity tokens.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.000
Perhaps

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.770
you'd like to keep them.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.360
[Lyu Yi]

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.170
Let's eat.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.930
What's wrong?

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.900
Are you not eating

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.579
because you're afraid
I poisoned the food

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.040
when you weren't looking?

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.400
An honorable person

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.700
would never stoop to vile tricks.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.310
I believe

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.720
you're the same.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.040
There's something

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.650
I'd like to know about.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430
You've called out a name several times
in your dreams—

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.440
Jin'an.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.710
Who is this person?

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.320
I found him in the wild.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.990
He lost his memory

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.560
and forgot who he was.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.990
So I let him stay in my residence

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.020
to do chores.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.560
So that means

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.150
he's a servant?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.270
Yes.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.240
A useless servant

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.610
who always got into trouble.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.610
But he was a good cook

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.500
and knew how to cheer me up.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.510
Afraid I'd get bored eating alone,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.580
he always kept me company—

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.330
just like you're doing now.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.070
You actually

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.190
care about

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.650
a lowly servant so much.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.780
Prince Annan,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.680
have you ever loved a woman?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.670
I protect my country and people,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.230
focused on making my mark.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.520
How could I let romance

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.920
hold me back?

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.070
So you wouldn't understand…

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.930
why I care about him.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.690
I don't need to understand.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.360
But what I do see

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.960
is that you're in danger

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.490
while the one you care for
is nowhere to be found.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.430
So why do you

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.810
still care for him?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.110
It's getting late.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.130
Prince Annan, you should go.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.920
Wait.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.810
Next time you come,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
could you please

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.190
bring me a qin?

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.070
You're a prisoner of war,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.610
yet you're in the mood for music?

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.920
I won't sign
the letter of surrender anyway,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.050
and you won't kill me

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.460
or let me go.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.270
Rather than spending my days worrying,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.350
I might as well do something I enjoy

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.480
to pass the time.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.930
Besides,

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.720
you look a bit like Jin'an.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.010
When you visit me,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.120
it makes me happy.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.950
Don't you dare compare me

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.750
to that lowly servant again.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.830
I said half a month,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.030
but with my remarkable skills,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.370
I finished grinding

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.040
all 1,000 bundles of herbs

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.810
in just

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:50.710
a few days.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.670
Miss Lu, you're packing.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.360
Are you going on a journey?

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.510
During my time on Wuling Mountain,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.960
although I didn't become
a master of medicine,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.510
I did make some progress.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.150
Therefore,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.960
Master, please allow me

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.150
to leave the mountain
to practice medicine.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.870
No!

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.480
Why not?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.600
No reason.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.080
It's the rule of Wuling Mountain.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.510
What is learned on the mountain

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.960
must stay on the mountain.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.000
There have been no exceptions
for hundreds of years.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.720
Rules

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.600
are meant to be broken.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.510
Back in Lucheng,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.180
didn't you save Su Muyang?

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.670
If you could do it, why can't I?

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.650
Or is it because

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.360
Su Muyang is royalty,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.130
so his life is more valuable

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.390
than a commoner's?

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.360
That's why I regret it!

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.600
After I saved him,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.910
he conspired with Jin Wujian

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.360
and put Jin'an and Li Shuang in danger.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.240
They almost died.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.960
Saving lives is not wrong!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.600
Why confuse the 2 things?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.750
When you help people

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.480
who have suffered from illness recover,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.510
when you see them regain hope

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.640
and hear them say thank you sincerely,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.240
don't you feel
a sense of accomplishment?

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.270
A sense of accomplishment?

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.910
That's just vanity.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.870
I don't care about

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.870
worldly success.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.480
Fine!

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.480
I care!

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.650
You're lofty and detached.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.960
I'm shallow to the core.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.360
I just want to do my best

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.360
to relieve people's suffering

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.790
and hear them sincerely thank me.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.750
Enough talk.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.870
Today, you want to leave the mountain,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.670
but I, as your master, forbid it.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.150
If you insist on leaving,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.000
you'll no longer be my disciple.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.390
Then so be it!

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.910
If being your disciple

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.120
means following stupid rules,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.080
I'd rather not be.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.360
Get out! Get out!

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.080
I...

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.240
What's wrong?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.800
What's wrong?

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:10.920
I ground

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.400
1,000 bundles of herbs in 7 days.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.830
My arms are so sore.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.540
And you're talking back to me.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.410
The pain-relieving ointment I developed.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.820
Try it.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.690
See if it works instantly.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.800
Using it on a heartless person like you

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.050
is really a waste.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.360
Go, go, go.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.950
Go by yourself.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.900
Go, go, go!

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:53.790
Go by yourself.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.710
Prince Annan,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.560
have you ever loved a woman?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.750
You look a bit like Jin'an.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.960
When you visit me,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.030
it makes me happy.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.040
Prince Annan,

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.440
what can I do for you?

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.480
I remember you said

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.800
after the defeat in Lucheng,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.080
you searched everywhere for me

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.360
and finally

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.360
found me in Taijin.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.920
Yes.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.740
That's right.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.830
Why do you ask?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.030
During your search in Taijin,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.550
did you ever meet

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.550
a man who looked much like me,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.030
named Jin'an?

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.000
Looked like you?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.670
Impossible.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.270
Absolutely impossible.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.970
You have the looks

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.070
and bearing

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.950
no ordinary man could ever match.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.270
I never saw

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.030
the man you spoke of.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.070
Prince Annan,

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.910
why are you suddenly asking about this?

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.710
A few days ago, in the courtyard,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.750
I had a brief conversation with Li Shuang.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.840
Strangely enough,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.610
she mentioned some matters

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.120
I knew nothing of,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.520
yet they felt so real—

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.540
like I'd lived through them myself.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.790
The Taijin people are

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.910
cunning

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.370
and silver-tongued.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.280
Prince Annan,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.410
we haven't avenged our state yet.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.890
Don't let her mislead you.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.670
Prince Annan!

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.640
You startled me. What's the matter?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.480
Speak slowly.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.390
Prince Annan,

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.750
something's happened in the courtyard.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.450
Prince Annan.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.000
What's wrong with you guys?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:29.840
In…

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.620
in the house.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.990
Who taught you to play the qin like that?

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.540
Self-taught.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.650
If you're bored,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.350
take a walk in the courtyard.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.590
Or,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.200
I'll have someone bring you some books.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.240
But the qin—

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.600
don't play it again.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.510
Why not?

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.480
You excel in both civil and martial arts,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.740
but you lack one thing:

00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.950
self-awareness.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.610
But unfortunately,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.510
I just love

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.260
playing the qin.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.000
Besides, playing the qin

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.740
nurtures the heart and mind.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.760
Prince Annan, when you have time,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.960
you should play it too

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.500
to ease that violent temper of yours.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560
These medicines—

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.960
some are to take, some are to apply.
All necessary.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.200
Being picky

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.470
will only delay your recovery.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.540
Don't tell me
the renowned general of Taijin

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.050
has trouble drinking bitter decoctions.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.790
Ridiculous!

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.990
Why would I have trouble with that?

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.310
It's sweet.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.920
The other day,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.829
I noticed you applied
all the wound medicines

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.630
but didn't take the decoctions.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.030
I guessed
you didn't like the bitter taste,

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.510
so I had honey added to it.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.580
If you'd had the courage
to try it even once these past few days,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.120
you'd have known it wasn't bitter at all.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.080
You added…

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:43.440
honey in the decoction?

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.540
Don't look at me like that.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.550
As my prisoner of war,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.950
you need to be in good health.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.270
Wait.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.570
It's very kind of you

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.440
to say that.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.400
Let me play a tune

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:21.960
to thank you.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.510
No need.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.460
I'll take my leave.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.210
Wait.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.800
I've said I'll play for you,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.750
so you can't leave without listening.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.680
Besides,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.600
it's Jin'an's favorite piece.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.070
Since he's not here,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.500
you'll listen on his behalf

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.520
and see if I play well.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.310
What do you think?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.830
Wonderful.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.720
Wait.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.300
Since you like it,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.090
I'll play a few more pieces.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.200
The qin is an elegant instrument.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.750
How can you play it like this?

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.920
Was it that bad?

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.630
Sit properly.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.220
Hands in position.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.980
Curl your fingers.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.920
Good.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.280
Let's begin.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.300
This is how you play.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.060
Not so good.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880
You have no taste.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.410
Just because you didn't get praised,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.670
Prince Annan,

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.350
there's no need to be so upset.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.090
Why don't you

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.380
play a few more pieces?

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.240
I'll try to appreciate them.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.070
I respect you
because you're a military commander too.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.530
I won't treat you harshly,

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.830
but you must know your place.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.240
I'm not

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.730
keeping you here for nothing.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.060
Your words remind me.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.110
I must eat.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.030
When I eat,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.390
the Changfeng Army eats with me.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.090
Since keeping me serves a great purpose,

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.310
I presume you won't

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.600
begrudge me a little food.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.120
Don't play useless tricks.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.050
I've seen

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.620
plenty of women before.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.610
What kinds of women have you seen before?

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.580
Wait.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.090
I'm out of candy.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.110
He really ground
1,000 bundles of herbs.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.260
So many of them.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.790
I'll definitely repay you later.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.270
I'm taking them.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.230
[Wuling Mountain]

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.270
You've got some nerve…

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.680
to steal the herbs.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.960
It's not stealing.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.960
During my time on Wuling Mountain,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.290
I've worked out plenty of prescriptions.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.040
You should give me something in return.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.520
These are just the most common herbs

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.730
here on Wuling Mountain.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.750
You won't need them
for your precious pills.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.640
But in my pharmacy,

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.580
they're really important.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.110
I owe you.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.200
Name your price.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.800
Money or my life?

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.080
I'll repay you one day.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.200
One day?

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.480
Will you even be able to repay me?

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.410
Your arms are fine now?

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.670
The ointment I made

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.640
worked well, didn't it?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.070
It barely helped.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.020
I recovered quickly

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.400
because I'm strong.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.880
I've decided

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.920
to go down the mountain

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.160
with you today

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.860
to prevent

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.550
your strange prescriptions

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.780
from harming people

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.260
and ruining Wuling Mountain's reputation.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.240
What are you waiting for?

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.400
Keep up.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.830
I knew you couldn't bear to part with me.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:32.860
Let's go.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.160
Look.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.790
The sun is rising.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.920
We've watched the sunset together,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.400
and now the sunrise too.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.200
Perfect.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.670
Forgive me, Prince Annan.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.240
I'll practice harder when I return

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.570
and will never play the wrong notes again.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.720
Compared to her,

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.220
your mistake

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:53.880
is nothing.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.800
You may leave.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.920
Prince Annan,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.450
the medicine is ready.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.200
Since you came back
from the courtyard last time,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.530
you've been drinking
the calming decoction for days.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.590
That girl's qin playing is dreadful.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.510
Could it be some kind of dark magic?

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.710
Don't talk nonsense!

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.960
Prince Annan,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.160
Li Shuang

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.880
still refuses to surrender.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.720
She's probably just stalling for time.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.590
Rather than wasting effort on her,

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.160
we should

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.310
take the initiative

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.170
and catch the enemy off guard.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.310
That last battle—

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.450
why do you think

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.750
we fought it?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.870
Isn't it obvious?

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.000
To drive out the Taijin Army

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.070
and defend our land.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.130
That's one reason.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.830
The second reason

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.040
is to make Taijin
see the situation clearly

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.570
and reopen peace talks.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.020
Those thousands of captured soldiers

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.040
are our brothers who fought alongside us.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.010
I must save them.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.680
By the way, Prince Annan,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.270
the house where Miss Li is held

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.530
is quite dilapidated.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.070
The roof has several leaks.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.240
The winds have been strong lately.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.170
Shall we send someone to repair it?

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.380
Li Shuang has an iron will.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.230
A bit of wind is nothing to her.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.680
Let her suffer.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.490
Let's see how long she can hold on.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.790
Understood.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.760
You may go.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.340
How many times have I told you?

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.750
Never mention that woman
in front of Prince Annan again.

Why not?

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:46.790
Haven't you noticed?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.960
Prince Annan seems

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.680
to be doubting what happened to him

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680
in Taijin.

This woman

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.350
was once his wife.

If she uses this

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.970
to undermine our troops' morale,

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.860
it could ruin everything.

-Physician Lu, thank you.
-Physician Lu.

It's healed!

They're not healed yet,

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.480
but I feel so happy inside.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.230
You were gone for so long.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.320
When you weren't in Lucheng,

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.920
we didn't even dare to get sick

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.070
because there was no physician
as good as you.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.820
Getting sick isn't something to wish for.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.420
I'd rather close my clinic

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.920
if it meant all of you

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.350

Your constipation is still
the same old problem.

Take your medicine regularly,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.990
exercise more,
sleep early, and rise early.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.850
It can still be cured completely.

Yeah.

Physician Lu,

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.410
there are so many frauds
in jianghu these days.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.640
You should be careful

about who you hire.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.310
That's right.

Yes, don't get deceived.

Alright, everyone,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.210
I know you're concerned about me.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.550

my new assistant.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.080
I see.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.070
I've already tested his character.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.040
He's reliable.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.270
It's just that for now,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.550
he's not familiar

with your chronic conditions,

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.640
so he can only

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.070
assist with minor tasks.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.350

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.640

an envoy for peace talks,

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.150
Under these circumstances,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.950
ending the war to rest and rebuild

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.320
is the only right path.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.420
However,

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.440
as the ruler,

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.780
my word carries weight,

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.110
and I can't go back on it.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.190
Even if my previous order
to wage war was a mistake,

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.190
I cannot publicly change my stance.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.800
So you,

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.220
Grand General,

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.710
had to take the brunt

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.260
and become the target of criticism.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.450
I've pledged
to serve the state until I die.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.800
With the state in crisis,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.760
my reputation is nothing.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.630
Besides, in this matter,

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.360
I have my personal motives.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.760
Thank you, Your Majesty,

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.050
for allowing me to save my daughter.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:27.850
Shuang is now

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.150
imprisoned.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.550
Isn't it also because of me?

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.760
How could I

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.670
possibly accept your thanks?

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.890
Your Majesty is too modest.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.550
I still remember when I was a child,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.360
I spent time at the General's Residence,

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.440
learning from you

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.360
with Shuang.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.880
Sometimes I wonder,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.480
since I ascended the throne,

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.100
whether my deeds

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.920
have lived up to

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.920
the 3 words written
by the founding emperor:

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.880
diligence and benevolence.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.280
The past is the past.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.410
Dwelling on it serves no purpose.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.600
From now on,

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.760
as long as Your Majesty stays true
to your conscience

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.920
and to your people,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.640
Taijin will be at peace.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.480
Father.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.030
Ting.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.030
It's so late.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.150
What is it?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.610
What's wrong, Ting?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.660
You're a grown man now.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.590
Don't hug me like a kid.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.070
Father,

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.110
are you going to the Yao State

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.840
to fight a war?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.020
I'm going to negotiate peace.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.300
For the peace and prosperity of Taijin,

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.900
there should be no more wars.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.800
Prince Annan

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.800
is Jin'an, isn't he?

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.960
If you go to the Yao State

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.840
and see him,

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.280
tell him this for me:

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.230
if he dares harm you
or Shuang in the slightest,

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.760
I will kill him myself.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.840
Ting,

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.360
you're grown now.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.590
There are things you must remember.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.760
There are truths

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.360
you must understand.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.440
Whenever there is war,

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.110
bloodshed and sacrifice are inevitable.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.320
On the battlefield,

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.280
life and death are beyond our control.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.670
Shuang and I

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.130
lead troops into battle

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.840
to end wars,

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.770
not for hatred or killing.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.080
Do you

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.070
understand this?

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.960
Then Shuang…

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.190
she will return safely,

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.150
won't she?

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.670
I will make sure your sister

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.510
returns safely.
