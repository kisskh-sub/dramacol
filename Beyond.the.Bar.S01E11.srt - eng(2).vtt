BEYOND THE BAR

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.048
{\an8}Hello.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.132
{\an8}I'm here for Hash.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:51.510
{\an8}Yoon Seok-hoon.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.720
We need to talk.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:00:59.935
What did you say to Yeon-a?

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:02.104
She seemed down for a few days

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:03.855
after seeing you last time.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.774
She said she's feeling empty inside.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:07.943
Must I answer?

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.946
Just a few words from you
is all it takes for her.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.325
- It was more than a few.
- That's not the point.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.454
You hung around just to tell me that?

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:20.789
As if.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.500
Speak your piece. You have five minutes.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:27.754
Once Miracle is born--

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.006
"Miracle"?

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.466
Our baby's pet name.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.345
Once Miracle is born,
we're going to move to Singapore.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.599
I got an expat assignment in Singapore.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:40.851
Once that's done,

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.604
I plan to switch to a local company
and continue living there.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.939
It seems like a better place
to raise kids.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.567
- What about Hash?
- He's coming with us.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.360
And who says you can take him?

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:52.070
Are you declaring war?

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.614
No, it's not that--

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:54.573
Not a chance.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.532
Hey.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.660
We have him on weekdays
and you on weekends,

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.454
which makes us his primary caretakers.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.497
Who made you his caretaker?

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:05.292
You are just the husband
of Hash's co-caretaker.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.419
Who are you to split us up?

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.254
I'm not trying to split you up--

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:10.213
Shut up.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.134
I will pursue legal action,
so don't do anything rash.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.434
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:27.314
Let's go.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.108
Why are you telling me to get a cat?

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:31.985
It'd be just another hassle.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.571
You'll get lonely once I'm in Daegu.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.949
Lonely?

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.576
Apart from the last few years,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.536
you've mainly worked away
in regional courts.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.372
Why the sudden fuss?

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.543
Let's just take a look.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.713
They say cats are easier
to take care of than dogs.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:05.477
All our kittens stay with their mother
for about three months.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.646
They're gentle and healthy.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.691
The most popular breeds

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:13.735
are British Shorthairs,
Ragdolls, and Munchkins.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.779
She is the daughter of a champion.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.239
Oh, a champion?

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:21.201
Yes, her dad is Tristan,
a golden British Shorthair

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.328
who won at a TICA cat show.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:26.123
Both her pedigree and breed are excellent.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.625
She's like a puppy.
She's very affectionate.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.211
Would you like to hold her?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.672
Sure. Why don't you give it a go?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.141
Why does the fire inspection test
have to be so loud?

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.309
Sorry. I keep asking them
to lower the volume

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.103
because it scares the kittens.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.069
{\an8}KANG HYO-MIN

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.947
{\an8}28 YEARS AGO

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.176
It's okay. I'll be right there.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:23.930
{\an8}I'm sorry about that, sweetheart.
Did I scare you?

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.225
I'm so sorry. Please don't cry.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.066
{\an8}KANG HYO-JU

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.278
Hold on, sweetheart.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.200
Sweetheart?

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:57.756
Sweetheart.

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.762
It's okay. Mommy will protect you.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.019
What's wrong with that one?

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.148
Oh, she's not available.

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.442
She's a special-needs cat
who used to be a stray.

00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:19.611
She's deaf and can't even meow.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.949
My goodness, they all hid.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.742
They'll come out in just a second.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.036
Hey, can you grab some treats for them?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:33.333
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.168
Honey.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:42.259
THE TWO-LEGGED BEAST

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.143
Hello.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.272
Are you Mr. Yoon Seok-hoon?

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.940
Yes, that's me.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.900
So cool.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.902
I've never met a real lawyer.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.071
Let's take a selfie.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.449
To mark this occasion.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.285
One, two.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.877
This is Ms. Kang Hyo-min,
one of the lawyers on my team.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.842
- Hello, I'm Kang Hyo-min.
- I see. Hello.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.805
You mentioned a privacy violation lawsuit
against TK Telecom.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.142
Can you tell us
what personal data was breached?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.686
When I bought my new phone,

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.565
I had the TK store
transfer over my old phone's data.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:42.027
But I forgot to log out
of my cloud account,

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:47.365
and an employee saw a video,
which he then reported to the police.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.409
What sort of video?

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.953
I thought it'd be better to just show you.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.123
Just a moment.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.920
CHOCO, GUHYEON-DONG
SEOLGI, HONGYEON-DONG

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:03.757
DUBU, HUIWON-DONG

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.716
{\an8}LOADING

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.070
Remember to keep that energy up. Okay?

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.239
We're going to have some fun today.

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.910
I think we get the picture.
You can turn it off now.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.454
His name is Dubu.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.747
He is just so affectionate.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:38.041
We got the idea.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.335
Is that enough?

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:50.679
You may leave.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:53.848
Pardon?

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.475
I'll handle this case by myself.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.521
Okay.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.867
Based on the footage,

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.495
the employee's report
appears to be justified.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.289
Animal cruelty is a criminal offense,

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.625
and the employee's report

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.545
can be deemed as a lawful act
carried out for the public good.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.922
How is that lawful?

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.051
This is my private life,
and the video is my personal data.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.262
And he leaked it to the police.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.513
Is that not illegal?

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.724
Personal privacy is protected by law.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.143
However,

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:42.105
exceptions are made
if it involves criminal conduct.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:44.607
Is that so?

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.862
Then, can you be my defense attorney?

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.822
The case was turned over
to the prosecution.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.366
Unfortunately, we won't be able
to take on this case.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.367
Why not?

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.912
You're a top lawyer.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.547
I have another meeting.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.268
That's just absurd.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:23.271
So a TK store employee
reported him to the police,

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.106
and he's calling that
a personal data breach?

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.775
That punk.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.861
He pulled a fast one to land the meeting.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.697
Contact the person who reported it
and offer to represent them.

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.784
Then file the notice of representation
with the prosecutors.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.620
Although we haven't
officially been retained,

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.581
it does constitute a conflict of interest
since we obtained the information

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.083
through a client meeting.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.918
A lawyer's ethics are very important.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.921
However, the law falls short
when it comes to animal rights.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:51.132
So I do not have the luxury
of fussing over ethical technicalities.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.760
Then we'll file
the notice of representation

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.804
and submit an opinion brief
to the prosecution

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.597
that calls for a stern sentence.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.518
Partner with an animal protection group
to file a public-interest complaint

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.311
and prepare for a civil lawsuit as well.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.855
We must exert financial pressure
through a damages claim.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.565
Should we let the media know as well?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.192
I think turning this into a public issue

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.319
will ensure a harsh sentence.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.864
There has been public outcry
over several similar cases in the past,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.991
but the law hasn't caught up.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.244
Preventing reoffending
is more important than punishment.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.703
But still,

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.248
it's unlikely he'd be tried
while in custody.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:27.043
And if he appeals,
it'll take about two years.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.338
And in the meantime,
how many more dogs will have to suffer?

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.508
This could even end
without a prison sentence.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:37.178
{\an8}Imprisonment for animal cruelty cases
is extremely rare.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:40.056
{\an8}Let's begin by taking all actions
permitted under existing law.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.183
File for an animal ownership ban

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.937
and a restraining order to prevent
any access to animal shelters.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.689
Yes, sir.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.442
A history of animal abuse could be
a sign of psychopathic tendencies.

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.236
There's a chance
he may have harmed people,

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.947
so see if there are any unsolved cases
surrounding Jung Wu-sol.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.783
The victims would
most likely be unhoused people

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.618
or vulnerable elderly people.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.745
Yes. Understood.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.123
Then I'll leave you to it.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.542
Mr. Lee, may I have a word?

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.419
Me? Okay.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:14.507
That's nonsense.

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.426
I mean, Hash isn't just some dog.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.928
He was abandoned at birth,
but you lovingly nurtured him

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.597
into becoming the decent man…

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.682
I mean, the decent dog he is today.

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.392
Calm down and take a seat.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:27.187
Wait, so what are you going to do?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.941
I'll file a preliminary injunction.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.944
I don't feel comfortable doing it myself,
so I'm going to hire someone.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.238
Do you know any lawyers
experienced in this area?

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.033
I'll have to look into it.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.744
Wait. I'm a lawyer too.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.705
No need to look far. I'll do it for you.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.709
What's with that look?

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.711
Don't tell me

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.339
you're questioning
my abilities as an attorney.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.840
No. Not at all.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:57.508
I'm not.

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:01.095
But have you ever handled
a lawsuit involving pets?

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.389
Sadly, as you mentioned earlier,

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.808
animals are still classified
as property under the law,

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.144
so it'll be the same
as a personal property injunction.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.354
I do that all the time.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.190
And who knows your situation
better than me?

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:16.527
I'll…

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.323
give it my best shot.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.496
Okay. I look forward to working with you.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.580
You know I'm not cheap.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.249
Yeah.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.502
I'll take care of the paperwork.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.503
Okay.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.258
Jeez, you scared me.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.300
Mr. Lee.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:41.052
What are you doing here?

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.638
I wanted to ask about this.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:45.014
But what was that about?

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.141
You don't need to know.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:48.851
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:49.811
What is it?

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.939
Really?

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.023
That's just wrong.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.108
Right?

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.527
Hash isn't just some dog to Mr. Yoon.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.195
- It's his son.
- Exactly.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.532
I'll help out too.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:04.826
Why?

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.620
I'm just doing this off the clock.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.914
This won't affect
your performance review at all.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:11.708
I'm sure it won't.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.709
Then why?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.712
Why would I pass up a chance
to learn more from you?

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.423
Come on now.
What could I possibly teach you?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.178
I'm sure I can find something,

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.765
but ask Mr. Yoon first.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.392
I'll let you in once he agrees.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.853
He might not want to reveal
his private life to an associate.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:32.979
Then what about you?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.689
I'm his immediate subordinate.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.566
You are two steps below him.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.650
Okay. Pay attention.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.777
You are here. I'm here.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.863
Ms. Heo is here.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.614
Mr. Yoon is here.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.037
Good.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.955
Our food's here.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:53.082
- That's a huge portion.
- Wow.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.334
- Thank you.
- That looks good.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.544
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:58.338
Enjoy.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.131
- This looks so good.
- It does.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:01.924
All right.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:08.848
What are you doing?

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.099
I know how to cut meat.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.101
- That's enough. Stop it!
- Just take it.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.480
Hey, Newbie.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.316
Go and eat over there. Don't butt in.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.986
Don't yell at her
when she's just enjoying her meal.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.029
Eat up.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.615
Unbelievable.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.165
- Isn't it good?
- Isn't it good?

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.167
It's so good.
This place knows what they're doing.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.460
Seriously.

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.628
It's good.

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:45.093
Gosh, who's calling during lunch?
It's just bad manners.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.432
Hello, sir. No, it's fine.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.060
What kind of lawyer takes a lunch break?

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.645
Sure.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.649
Yes, of course.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:01.734
DAD

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.992
You know I'm being transferred
to Daegu District Court, right?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.495
I'll come back on weekends,

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.123
but check in on Mom when you can.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.457
Love you always.

00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:21.003
You're sighing as if the world's ending.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.005
Ms. Heo.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:27.635
That woman you met the other day
at that café is your daughter, right?

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:28.594
Yeah.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.724
I guess even moms
have a hard time getting over

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.685
their daughters hurting them, right?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:39.147
Right. Mothers are people too.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.400
But a mother-daughter relationship

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:43.776
is rather complicated.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.112
There's hate and love at the same time.

00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:48.573
You can't stand each other,
yet you miss each other.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:52.410
Do you think other moms
and daughters are like that too?

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:55.163
I think it's safe to assume
most are like that.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:57.623
Perfect moms and daughters
are hard to come by.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.669
- Why do you think that is?
- I'm not sure.

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.754
Maybe it's due to inexperience.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.924
Both moms and daughters learn as they go.

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.097
Why do you ask?
Did you do something to upset your mom?

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.976
I think I hurt her a bit.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:22.023
Whatever it was, she probably is hurt.
You are her daughter, after all.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.984
But you know, that wound
is surprisingly easy to heal.

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.903
Because you're her daughter.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.947
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:33.659
My daughter once hurt me quite a bit too.

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.829
But when she called me "Mom"
the other day…

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:37.914
Mom.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:48.132
It was game over for me.
Everything melted away.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.636
- Really?
- You'll know when you become a mom.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.680
I hear that all the time.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:59.060
All love is amazing and noble,

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.896
but there's something
a little more special about a mom's love.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:05.316
You can't fully understand it
just from secondhand experience.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.985
That's why the worst thing
a mom can say to her daughter is,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.695
"I hope your daughter is just like you."

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.657
I would not like that at all.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.035
I know it's a cliché,
but treat her well while you still can.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.412
Always be grateful
that your mom is still around.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.122
Treat her with care.

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.210
Do you have
a good relationship with your mom?

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:25.545
She passed away.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.758
Seeing your mom lying in the mortuary

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.887
is a really jarring sight.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.140
You wonder,
"Was my mom always this small?"

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:43.563
You can't say goodbye
without feeling remorse.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:44.522
But still,

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.608
you should avoid
scarring your heart if you can.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:52.071
So I'm telling you
to treat her well for your sake.

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.781
Take one brick at a time,

00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:55.950
and build a protective wall of love

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.160
so it hurts less later on.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.288
I will, Ms. Heo.

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.455
Eat up.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:09.338
Wait. My tumbler.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.257
Go ahead. I'll go get my tumbler.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.383
- Okay.
- See you.

00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:14.677
Go on. Hurry now.

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:16.846
You're ridiculous.

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.557
How oblivious can she be?

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:22.602
What are you trying to do here?

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.021
You might as well grab a megaphone
and tell the world.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.230
Can I?

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.398
- I am--
- Stop it!

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:28.816
Jeez.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:30.443
You're unbelievable.

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.112
- Ta-da.
- What is that?

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:35.489
I thought my woman might be tired.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.075
I'm being a supportive partner.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.078
I don't eat candy anymore. I quit sugar.

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:42.705
This is sugar-free.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.458
But my heart is full of sweetness for you.

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.128
Give me one.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:50.504
Say, "Ah."

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.216
It's so good.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.426
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:56.969
I eat these all the time.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.804
Give me another one.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.014
- Two?
- Yeah.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:02.141
I should have at least two at a time.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.806
Do you have a dog too?

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.708
What's your deal, you bastard?

00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:11.001
I haven't done anything.

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.045
Ms. Kang, you step out first.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.214
Okay.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:18.509
That hurts.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.729
Add his face to the recognition system
and blacklist him.

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.731
Make sure
he's never allowed in here again.

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:33.566
Yes, sir. Let's go.

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:44.160
What a psycho perv.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.455
Thank goodness for Mr. Yoon.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.583
What are you talking about?
I know taekwondo.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:53.502
Stop messing around.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.297
The smartest move in that situation
is removing yourself.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.256
Yeah.

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:00.593
Anyhow, has your mom texted you back?

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.552
No.

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.264
You better not tell my mom about this.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.849
I won't.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.143
You flipped the last time
I talked to her about you.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:12.188
- I haven't called her in days.
- She hasn't reached out to you?

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.064
No, I haven't heard from her.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:18.235
Poor Ms. Choi. She must be so upset.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.238
She's ignoring my texts
and not even calling Ji-eun.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.574
If she's not texting you back,
just call her.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:26.118
I did. She didn't pick up.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:28.996
That must be Ms. Choi.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.125
Hello?

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.295
Ms. Kang. Where are you right now?

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.546
I'm home.

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:39.423
Did something happen?

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.966
Well…

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.345
I got hit by a car,
and I'm in the hospital right now.

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.387
What?

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.598
Are you hurt badly?

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.433
No, I'm okay.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:54.396
To tell you the truth,
I was working a part-time delivery job.

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:55.898
Why?

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:57.900
For your mom's debt?

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:01.403
No, I made sure to set
clear boundaries with her about that.

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:05.032
I was going to get a gym membership,
but I figured this was a quicker way

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.910
to get some exercise
and save up for our new place.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.371
I only do it sometimes
when I don't have to work late.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:12.331
I see.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.543
I'm going to be discharged on Sunday.

00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.211
Then what about the twins?

00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:20.506
They're at my aunt's.
It's her day to watch them.

00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:23.634
But tomorrow is the issue.

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:26.846
I promised them we'd go out
since it's the weekend.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.640
Do you want me to babysit?

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:32.685
Really? It's the weekend.
Don't you have plans?

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:34.061
No, I don't.

00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:35.855
You mean it?

00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:38.607
We just became friends,
and I'm already an inconvenience.

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:41.235
Come on, don't say that.

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.904
Don't worry. I'll take good care of them.

00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:46.240
Thank you so much.

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.993
Don't worry, and get better soon.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:53.205
- Who was that?
- Ho-yeon.

00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:55.124
- Is she hurt?
- Yeah.

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.751
She was in a car accident,
but it's not serious.

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:03.257
I'm such a genius.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.554
Hash, we need to pack this as well.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:13.058
KANG HYO-MIN

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:18.814
Hello?

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:21.817
Hello, Mr. Yoon! Did something happen?

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.614
No, nothing has happened.

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.034
Sorry.

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:36.916
I called you by accident.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.168
It's fine.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.045
I…

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:42.588
Yes?

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.758
I was wondering if you had plans tomorrow.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.218
I've got a few things going on.

00:23:48.302 --> 00:23:49.303
I see.

00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:51.305
Right. Of course.

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.183
Is everything okay?

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.402
{\an8}KANG HYO-JU

00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:10.824
It's okay.

00:24:11.492 --> 00:24:13.285
Mommy will protect you.

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.396
Ma'am, what brings you by at this hour?

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:44.942
We have other healthy kittens
with good pedigrees.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:48.404
And she might be a bit challenging
for someone without experience--

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:50.823
No, I'll take her.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.201
I'll learn as I go.

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:56.453
All right.

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:00.457
Then I'll give you
what you need for the night.

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:02.668
Litter boxes are crucial for cats.

00:25:03.293 --> 00:25:04.920
- I'll be back to explain further.
- Okay.

00:25:07.381 --> 00:25:09.008
All right.

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:19.727
Let's have some fun today.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.067
Hello.

00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:28.902
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:30.446
Hey there. How have you been?

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.864
- Good.
- Let's go.

00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:32.948
Come on, let's go.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.951
- You can do it
- You can do it

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:40.539
- Just tell us that
- Just tell us that

00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:44.418
- Then we can do anything
- Then we can do anything

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.671
- Whatever it may be
- Whatever it may be

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.007
Be careful.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.884
Seo-yeon, Mi-yeon, wait for us.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:56.055
This place is so nice.

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:57.431
Have you been here before?

00:25:57.514 --> 00:25:59.725
Yes, I come here often with Hash.

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:00.851
I see.

00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:03.228
The twins seem to like it too.

00:26:03.312 --> 00:26:07.191
This lodge is pet and kid-friendly.
I'm sure they'll like it.

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:11.153
I'm sorry for crashing in
on your quality time with Hash.

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:12.112
I didn't mean to.

00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:14.198
No, it's fine. This is actually better.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.493
It's nice. Hash seems to be enjoying
the company.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:22.289
I managed to reserve another room.
You can stay there with the twins.

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:23.582
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:26.293
Hash, no!

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.336
Hey!

00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.243
All right, Hash.

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:36.780
What are you up to?

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.950
Just relaxing. Where are the twins?

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.244
They totally passed out.

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.205
They must be tired.

00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.584
Hash looks tired too.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.460
Of course.

00:27:50.544 --> 00:27:52.588
Babysitting is exhausting.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.965
We had it easy, thanks to him.

00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:56.675
Yes, we did.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.347
Hash is just an angel.

00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:05.893
He's so smart. He matches
the kids' energy and plays with them.

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.436
I heard

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.689
that Hash might be moving overseas.

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.774
I overheard your conversation last time.

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:15.110
You did?

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.905
I want to help too.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.698
It's a personal matter.

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:21.950
And it's nothing complicated.

00:28:24.077 --> 00:28:26.330
It may not be complicated,
but it's important.

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:29.750
What good is being a lawyer

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:32.669
if we can't help each other
with legal matters?

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:35.923
The real reward comes
from helping and supporting one another.

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:39.092
Seeing you with Hash today

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:40.928
made me want to help even more.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.891
You know how capable I am.
I'm sure I could be helpful.

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:48.227
I am your greatest masterpiece, after all.

00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.480
All right. I accept.

00:28:52.272 --> 00:28:54.149
Thank you for choosing to retain me.

00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:55.400
I will give it my all.

00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:00.489
But…

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:04.368
I'm also worried about stopping them.

00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:07.412
My ex-wife is a painter
who mostly works from home.

00:29:07.496 --> 00:29:09.831
If something comes up,
her husband can step in.

00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:13.460
On the other hand, I'm alone.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.422
That's why you need Hash more.

00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.468
That is how I feel.

00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:24.638
But stopping them
could end up making Hash more lonely.

00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.847
That's true love.

00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.767
What was Hash like as a puppy?

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.186
He must've been cute.
Do you have pictures?

00:29:33.814 --> 00:29:35.607
He must have been about this big?

00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:37.943
He was really small.

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:40.404
So cute and adorable.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.239
Hold on.

00:29:51.331 --> 00:29:52.666
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

00:29:52.749 --> 00:29:54.167
- Registered mail.
- I see.

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:57.379
- Please sign here.
- Sure.

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:01.049
Here you go. Thank you.

00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:11.476
INJUNCTION PROHIBITING
TRANSFER OF POSSESSION

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.354
An injunction to stop
the transfer of possession.

00:30:15.772 --> 00:30:18.317
As if we didn't already know
you were a lawyer.

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:21.153
Look at you go all out, Yoon Seok-hoon.

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:22.112
Who is it?

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:27.826
Just some registered mail from work.

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:35.667
Thank goodness I decided
to work from home today.

00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:38.462
So this is how you want to play it? Fine.

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.218
- How about Chinese?
- What do you want to eat?

00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:47.804
- I was going to have a sandwich.
- A sandwich?

00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:49.598
- How about spicy sausage stew?
- Stew?

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.183
With some ramyeon noodles.

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.103
RECORDINGS, EMAIL, HYNIC CORE
MEETING MINUTES

00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.355
COPYING

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:03.987
Why are you so jumpy?

00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:06.448
You scared me.

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.908
Aren't you eating lunch?

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.577
You can go ahead.
I just need to finish this.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.039
Do it after you eat.
Don't skip meals to put food on the table.

00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:18.335
I just can't help
but feel sorry for you, Yun-geun.

00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:21.213
It's like you're being tortured
with false hope.

00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.090
Do you think that if you work hard enough,

00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:24.883
they'll let you be a lawyer here?

00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:56.206
Ms. Kwon.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.006
Get dressed.

00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:06.675
Pardon?

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.637
Who was it?

00:32:11.555 --> 00:32:13.098
Who put you up to this?

00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:16.184
What do you mean?

00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:19.604
Open the door.

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:35.495
I knew you were married, Ms. Kwon.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:40.125
And I know adultery
is morally reprehensible,

00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:42.752
- but I just fell for your charms--
- Just stop.

00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:45.505
I have no desire

00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:48.467
to ruin your bright future over this mess.

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.302
If you cooperate,

00:32:52.262 --> 00:32:53.555
I'll spare you.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.519
Could you give us a moment alone?

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:09.696
You know me, right?

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:10.739
Yes.

00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:15.577
I worked with you
on the Wiz Securities mis-selling case.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.915
I remember you being
quite capable back then.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.124
Yes.

00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:23.627
Thanks to your praise,

00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:26.588
I started getting
meaningful work assignments.

00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:30.008
You were the only one
who ever gave me…

00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:34.596
fair recognition.

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.183
Were you blackmailed?
Or were you promised a position?

00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:42.896
In this situation,

00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:45.899
I am the only one who can help you.

00:33:49.236 --> 00:33:50.403
It was both.

00:33:51.238 --> 00:33:53.156
To pay for law school,

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.409
I once worked
at an adult entertainment establishment.

00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.664
I was blackmailed with that.

00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:02.916
- By Ha Du-sik?
- Yes.

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:06.127
He promised that I'd be promoted
from a paralegal to an attorney.

00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:10.465
I checked your work log

00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:13.385
and saw that you were involved
both at the time of Bluestone's investment

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:16.346
and Hynic Core's sale to Optalyn.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.640
What was your assignment in those cases?

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:21.393
Just the menial tasks I always do.

00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:24.729
I organized the meeting notes,
made copies,

00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:27.566
and shredded confidential documents,
among other things.

00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:29.943
We cannot promise

00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:32.529
a promotion to attorney.

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:36.533
However, we can promise to create
a system where you will be

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:40.912
properly evaluated based solely
on the abilities you demonstrate at Yullim

00:34:40.996 --> 00:34:44.749
and not your law school background
or bar exam scores that have hindered you

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.418
up until now.

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:48.503
Mr. Ha Du-sik is backed

00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:52.048
by Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.

00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:54.593
- We're aware.
- He won't just stand by and watch.

00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.886
They'll make sure I never set foot
in the legal field.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.889
And you think Ms. Kwon
isn't capable of the same?

00:35:00.807 --> 00:35:02.684
Either way, you must choose.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.854
And no matter which way you choose,
you must prepare yourself

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:08.815
to be shunned in the legal profession
if things go wrong.

00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:12.193
However, we are
a step above them in one area.

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:13.153
What's that?

00:35:13.236 --> 00:35:14.904
We keep our promises.

00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:18.033
If you help us, you will be safe.

00:35:20.452 --> 00:35:22.871
And I promise
that you'll be evaluated fairly.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.549
What…

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:37.886
do I have to do?

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:40.347
I heard you keep recordings of everything.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.017
Do you still have the files
concerning Bluestone and Optalyn?

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:45.769
Yes.

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:48.438
I have all of them.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.940
I also still have
the confidential documents.

00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:51.941
Why?

00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:54.527
I swear I only kept those to study--

00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:56.279
Do you know what we're looking for?

00:35:57.572 --> 00:35:58.531
Yes.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.586
Come in.

00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.047
Mr. Ban Gi-seung is here.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.048
Sir!

00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:17.550
You may leave.

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.847
What's going on?
I told you to stay away from the office.

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.766
I apologize, but it's an emergency.

00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:26.810
Please take a look.

00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:30.814
What is this?

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.274
Optalyn has filed

00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:35.735
a lawsuit against Bluestone Fund.

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:38.029
A lawsuit? Why?

00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:41.157
For breaching the seller's
representations and warranties.

00:36:41.241 --> 00:36:42.492
What are you talking about?

00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:46.204
Optalyn purchased Hynic Core
for their NPU-based technology.

00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:47.706
To maintain and develop it,

00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:50.166
they need the core data
and operational logic.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.544
But the software code is encrypted,

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:55.714
and the core logic remains undocumented.

00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:58.591
It's practically impossible to implement.

00:36:58.675 --> 00:36:59.884
What?

00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:01.010
In other words,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.432
Optalyn basically bought
only the shell of the company.

00:37:05.974 --> 00:37:08.268
Hold on.
Were we not aware of this until now?

00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:10.729
Semiconductor technology
is not really our forte.

00:37:13.857 --> 00:37:17.110
We handed over all the materials
related to Hynic Core's technology.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.780
What exactly is the breach of contract?

00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:22.782
Clauses five and thirteen.

00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:28.913
SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

00:37:28.997 --> 00:37:30.999
Optalyn is seeking a contract termination,

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:34.461
the return of the purchase price,
and even compensation for damages.

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:35.962
How much?

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.884
The estimate is over 200 billion won.

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:45.680
Sir.

00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:49.142
How should we respond?

00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:53.563
Why are you asking me?

00:37:54.689 --> 00:37:58.610
Bluestone is a fund managed
by an asset management company.

00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:01.446
The asset management company
should figure this out.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:02.447
Wait.

00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:05.575
Sir, how could you say that now?

00:38:05.658 --> 00:38:07.911
You should leave.
There are a lot of prying eyes around.

00:38:07.994 --> 00:38:09.412
I'll be in touch.

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.164
Sir.

00:38:20.757 --> 00:38:21.716
Yes, sir.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.053
Understood.

00:38:57.418 --> 00:39:00.547
DAD

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:04.717
Hey, Dad.

00:39:04.801 --> 00:39:06.678
I can't reach Mom.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.596
Is she with you, by any chance?

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.100
No, I was actually just about to call you
to check if she's home

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.519
because I can't reach her either.

00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:16.020
Really?

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.525
I thought she was ignoring my calls
because she was upset with me.

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.985
I'll see if she's home.

00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:35.081
She's definitely home.

00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:37.375
Mom.

00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:43.089
Is she sleeping?

00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:46.342
Mom.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:49.929
Mom?

00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:52.348
Mom.

00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:54.976
What's wrong? What happened?

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:58.813
Hyo-min.

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.482
Hyo-min.

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.738
Hyo-min.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.618
I was so freaked out.

00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:14.370
I've never seen her cry like that.

00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:17.415
Wait. What's wrong with the kitty?

00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:19.584
It's a side effect of the vaccines.

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.628
Then you should take her to the vet.

00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:23.171
You think she didn't already?

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:26.674
I guess the ER gave the kitten
some antibiotics, and they're helping.

00:40:27.717 --> 00:40:31.095
But she just refuses to leave her side,
and she's crying with the saddest eyes.

00:40:32.722 --> 00:40:33.973
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:40:34.057 --> 00:40:36.100
Okay. Hurry.

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:49.906
Mom, Ji-eun is on her way here.

00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:54.118
Why? It's late.

00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:57.205
Her family has six cats.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.040
She's a total pro with cats.

00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:01.584
Really?

00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:03.044
Did you eat?

00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:06.255
I'm fine. I don't feel like eating.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:09.050
I assume you haven't been sleeping.

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.510
You look terrible.

00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:13.221
I'll cook something.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:15.640
No.

00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:18.184
I need to feed her in a bit.

00:41:19.435 --> 00:41:23.064
The vaccines made her lose her appetite,
so she's not eating.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:26.901
I've been force-feeding her
every two hours.

00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:28.903
I need to give her medicine too.

00:41:28.987 --> 00:41:30.279
I'll do it.

00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:32.323
After I make you something to eat.

00:41:41.082 --> 00:41:43.501
Mom, come out and eat.

00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:47.422
Mom.

00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:49.674
Mom.

00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:57.473
Gosh.

00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.770
You should sleep on the bed.

00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:21.456
- Where's your mom?
- She fell asleep while I was cooking.

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:25.168
She must have stayed up for days
looking after that little kitty.

00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:26.127
And the kitty?

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.670
In her hideout on the bed.

00:42:28.254 --> 00:42:30.339
She needs to eat and take her meds.

00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:32.550
- I'll do it after I wash my hands.
- Okay.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.471
Thanks.

00:42:55.698 --> 00:42:56.741
TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER BRIEF

00:42:56.824 --> 00:42:57.700
TO KO SEUNG-CHEOL

00:42:57.784 --> 00:42:58.743
MEETING NOTES

00:42:58.826 --> 00:42:59.994
EQUITY ACQUISITION METHOD

00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:01.829
It appears we have
the basic framework now.

00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:05.500
They probably have no idea
that we have a recording of this.

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:06.834
But this won't be enough.

00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:09.087
Mr. Ko really is a prudent man.

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:11.672
I don't think Ha Du-sik's words

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:14.092
will be enough
to serve as conclusive evidence.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.513
Evidence that proves Mr. Ko
is the mastermind behind all of it

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:21.557
must be in Bluestone's hands.

00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:22.767
I assume so.

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:26.437
But why would they ever give that up?
They're on the same team.

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.606
Those rotten bastards.

00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:29.732
Actually,

00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:34.153
Optalyn has filed
a suit against Bluestone.

00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:35.738
Why?

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:38.533
Optalyn purchased Hynic Core

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:40.910
for their NPU-based technology.

00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:45.331
But after the purchase, they realized
the software code was encrypted,

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:48.251
and the core operational logic
was not even documented.

00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:50.878
So they can't actually
use the technology right now.

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:52.421
What does that mean?

00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:56.008
Were there any technical documents
that Hynic Core kept from them?

00:43:56.092 --> 00:43:57.510
No, there weren't.

00:43:57.593 --> 00:44:00.179
Bluestone would never do that.
They took every last bit.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.890
But while we were
developing the technology,

00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:05.143
we didn't record every little thing.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.021
Then how would
the technology be implemented?

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:12.525
Well, you just do it.

00:44:13.442 --> 00:44:14.485
It's all in here.

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:19.490
That's also why
I was suspected of embezzlement.

00:44:20.116 --> 00:44:22.451
I kept all the financial records
in here too.

00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:27.707
"FPGA development board
purchased at 8.8 million won

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.458
on March 21, 2023. VAT included."

00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:32.128
"HBM3 memory module
purchased at 13.2 million won

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.088
on April 12. VAT included."

00:44:46.726 --> 00:44:49.020
- We can get your company back.
- What?

00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:51.480
- Really?
- Yes.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.985
We need to meet
with the asset management company first.

00:44:56.068 --> 00:44:58.321
This could create a rift between them.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.996
Cherry.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.499
Baby?

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.379
Ji-eun is taking care of her.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.048
Really?

00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:21.844
Get some more rest.
I told you, Ji-eun is a pro.

00:45:21.928 --> 00:45:25.139
She fed her and gave her the medicine.

00:45:25.223 --> 00:45:26.891
You should get some proper sleep.

00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:32.813
Come on.

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:41.530
I think she's feeling a bit better.
She's playing with Ji-eun right now.

00:45:41.614 --> 00:45:43.282
Don't worry. Get some sleep.

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:03.761
Why did you suddenly decide to get a cat?

00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:06.055
Your dad

00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:09.308
suggested it so I wouldn't get lonely.

00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:10.434
Jeez.

00:46:11.227 --> 00:46:14.146
You refused to let me have one.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.441
I didn't want to because
I'm still not confident I can raise one.

00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.528
But at the breeder's,

00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:22.822
I saw Cherry.

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:25.032
She reminded me of Hyo-ju.

00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:28.452
Hyo-ju?

00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:33.666
Cherry can't hear.

00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:35.543
She can't even meow.

00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:40.172
Really?

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.889
I brought her here
when she was doing just fine.

00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:52.226
I knew I couldn't do it.

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.812
I don't deserve to be a mother either.

00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:58.065
I can't take care of anyone.

00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:04.780
Don't say that.

00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:12.621
Vaccines sometimes cause side effects.

00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:15.124
You can't just blame yourself for that.

00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:26.469
Hyo-ju used to get hurt often
when she was little.

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:31.015
Maybe it was because she couldn't hear.
She just kept getting hurt.

00:47:33.225 --> 00:47:35.061
But she didn't even cry much.

00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:39.482
Her vocal cords were fine.
She could make sounds.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:46.197
At some point, it became an obsession.

00:47:48.324 --> 00:47:51.369
I would get anxious
if Hyo-ju wasn't in front of me.

00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:55.081
That's why

00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:58.167
I would watch her

00:47:58.918 --> 00:48:01.170
and follow her around all day.

00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:04.548
Now I know I was being overprotective.

00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:06.717
Maybe that's why

00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.179
she was a little slow in her development.

00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.181
Was she?

00:48:16.435 --> 00:48:18.312
And then, that incident happened.

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.314
What incident?

00:48:22.191 --> 00:48:25.486
Did something happen to Hyo-ju?

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:28.406
No.

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:32.785
Not to Hyo-ju. To you.

00:48:32.868 --> 00:48:35.538
Because I was busy hovering over Hyo-ju,

00:48:36.372 --> 00:48:39.166
I practically neglected you.

00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:42.670
After all, I can't be
in two places at once.

00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:48.509
Do you remember?

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.136
That time

00:48:51.137 --> 00:48:53.055
you fell down the stairs.

00:48:58.227 --> 00:48:59.270
Vaguely.

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:03.858
I think I broke my right arm

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:06.068
and my left leg.

00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:09.572
It was a complete mess.

00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:14.618
Hyo-ju's development was delayed
because I would fuss too much,

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:17.204
and you got hurt

00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:20.708
because I neglected you.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.917
I really am…

00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:26.672
terrible at everything.

00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:30.301
Don't say that.

00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:33.137
So,

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.681
is that why

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:39.185
you had Auntie adopt Hyo-ju?

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.067
It didn't happen right away.

00:49:56.368 --> 00:49:57.453
I…

00:50:00.748 --> 00:50:03.459
hurt your aunt in many ways.

00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:06.003
How?

00:50:06.712 --> 00:50:09.465
She introduced me to your uncle
before they got married,

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:13.636
and I found out he was born deaf.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.431
I don't know why
that made me so angry back then.

00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:20.559
I said a lot of hurtful things
to your aunt.

00:50:21.894 --> 00:50:24.522
She was eager to have a baby,

00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:27.775
but I told her not to.

00:50:29.068 --> 00:50:32.071
I asked her what the point would be
of having a deaf child.

00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:33.697
That's terrible.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.616
I know, right?

00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:37.868
Maybe…

00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:42.790
my words made it happen.

00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:46.752
It turned out your aunt
was actually infertile.

00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.630
Seeing Hyo-ju…

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:56.178
made me wonder
if my daughter was being punished

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:02.935
for all the terrible things
I said to my sister.

00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:10.442
I suddenly felt
I needed to apologize to her,

00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:14.947
so I called her, and she came running.

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.825
Without ever being a mother herself,

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:22.079
she instantly knew
what Hyo-ju needed and wanted.

00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:25.332
She made Hyo-ju,
who was always expressionless,

00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:29.086
smile.

00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:31.672
She even laughed out loud.

00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:34.842
It made me wonder

00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:38.762
if I had ever heard Hyo-ju's voice at all.

00:51:42.224 --> 00:51:44.018
Hyo-ju was one thing,

00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:48.022
but I also felt so sorry
for neglecting you all the time.

00:51:48.647 --> 00:51:51.567
You were also just a baby
wanting to feel your mom's touch.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.738
Back then,
I hadn't even realized you were gifted.

00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:58.824
I had never even read you a book.

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:02.620
Without ever having
a single book read to you,

00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:05.331
you learned to read
the Korean alphabet by yourself.

00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:14.381
I was an amazing daughter.

00:52:18.761 --> 00:52:20.387
You still are.

00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:24.308
Yeah.

00:52:27.603 --> 00:52:28.520
Aren't you hungry?

00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:32.691
A little.

00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:34.985
Should we have some ramyeon?

00:52:37.363 --> 00:52:38.572
Don't be absurd.

00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:46.121
Should we?

00:52:47.373 --> 00:52:48.624
How about four servings?

00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:01.220
Let's keep things amicable.

00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:04.098
My client is hoping to avoid litigation.

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.974
Nobody actively seeks litigation.

00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:08.644
It is simply done as a last resort.

00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:10.229
We should consider Hash's well-being.

00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:11.313
"Hash's well-being"?

00:53:11.397 --> 00:53:13.482
We're doing this
for the sake of his well-being.

00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:16.527
Our client is like a father to Hash.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.405
How could Hash ever find happiness
in some faraway, foreign land

00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.490
without his father around?

00:53:21.573 --> 00:53:22.574
- Hold on.
- His father--

00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:26.161
Let's set aside emotions
and address it purely on legal grounds.

00:53:26.245 --> 00:53:27.663
Legally, Hash is recognized

00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:30.916
as property jointly owned
by our client and the respondent.

00:53:30.999 --> 00:53:33.794
Custody rights during weekdays
and weekends are also clearly stipulated.

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.879
The respondent's attempt
to take him overseas

00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:37.297
is a clear breach of contract

00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:40.676
and constitutes a serious infringement
of our client's weekend custody rights.

00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:42.594
If no agreement is reached,

00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:44.346
we will petition the court

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.516
for a preliminary injunction
to impose a travel ban on Hash.

00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:50.644
Yoon Seok-hoon, can I see you outside?

00:53:50.728 --> 00:53:51.812
- You can't.
- No!

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:55.190
Seol Yeon-a is the respondent
on this injunction application.

00:53:55.274 --> 00:53:57.818
She is also the other party
in the divorce settlement agreement.

00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.278
But you…

00:54:01.697 --> 00:54:02.573
Mr. Jung Won-jun.

00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:04.575
- Mr. Jang Won-jun.
- Jung Won-jun.

00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:06.702
Right, Mr. Jung Won-jun.

00:54:07.786 --> 00:54:10.205
You're a third party with no connection
whatsoever to this case.

00:54:10.289 --> 00:54:12.249
What right does a third party have here

00:54:12.332 --> 00:54:14.251
to request to speak to our client?

00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:17.045
If there is something that you must say,

00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:21.049
we'd appreciate it if you did so
through the counsel present.

00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:33.854
Mr. Yoon.

00:54:36.982 --> 00:54:39.234
- Are you going to pick up Hash?
- Yes.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.112
Here. I bought some stuff for him.

00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:44.573
As a thank you
for your help babysitting last week.

00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:45.908
You didn't need to.

00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:48.619
My mom actually adopted a kitten,

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.622
so I just picked these up
while I was at the pet shop.

00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:54.124
I see. Your mom has a cat now.

00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:55.125
Yes.

00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:59.046
- That's a lot.
- Some treats and a collar.

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.547
It looked like he didn't have one.

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.133
Hash doesn't like collars.

00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:06.637
This isn't just any collar.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.847
It has a GPS feature,
so you can track his location.

00:55:08.931 --> 00:55:11.099
It has other smart functions too.

00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:13.477
It's small,
so it shouldn't bother him too much.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.770
Is that so?

00:55:15.354 --> 00:55:16.730
That's nice.

00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:20.150
If you don't mind,
could I give it to him in person?

00:55:20.776 --> 00:55:21.944
I miss him.

00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:24.071
I'll leave right afterward.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.614
Sure. Feel free.

00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:40.963
I can pair his collar
with the app on your phone.

00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:42.214
Can I see your phone?

00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:43.882
I can do it.

00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:46.885
I was given thorough instructions,
so just let me.

00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:47.845
Give me your phone.

00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:51.181
All right, then.

00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:00.691
Hello.

00:56:00.774 --> 00:56:02.401
- Hello.
- Hi there.

00:56:02.484 --> 00:56:05.779
I'm Yoon Seok-hoon's cousin.
I'm here to pick up Hash.

00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:08.073
You're a bit early.

00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:09.324
Yes.

00:56:09.408 --> 00:56:11.994
We need to confirm it
with the guardian on file first.

00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:15.289
I'll call him right now.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.083
Wait.

00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:20.669
He did say he had a trial today.

00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:21.837
No, it's fine.

00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:23.255
Just a moment.

00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:31.555
What do you mean someone else took him?

00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:32.514
Well,

00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:35.767
he said he was your cousin.

00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:47.988
It can't be.

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:58.540
Mr. Yoon, guess where we are.

00:56:58.624 --> 00:56:59.541
{\an8}DON'T CALL THE POLICE

00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:07.299
"Dad, please be his attorney."

00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:09.968
"Why are you playing so hard to get?"

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.306
If you are willing to defend this client,

00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:15.807
you're welcome to come here.

00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:17.476
The address is

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.103
a secret!

00:57:32.658 --> 00:57:36.286
A history of animal abuse could be
a sign of psychopathic tendencies.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.245
PERSONAL DETAILS

00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:38.997
There's a chance
he may have harmed people,

00:57:39.081 --> 00:57:42.042
so see if there are any unsolved cases
surrounding Jung Wu-sol.

00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:51.468
SERIES OF PET DISAPPEARANCE CASES
IN HUIWON-DONG, SAPYEONG-GU

00:57:54.096 --> 00:57:55.180
Mr. Yoon.

00:57:55.889 --> 00:57:58.225
Mr. Yoon, pull yourself together.

00:57:58.976 --> 00:58:00.435
We need to go find Hash.

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.194
Sir, can you go a little faster?

00:58:10.112 --> 00:58:13.115
Mr. Yoon, you cannot get emotional.

00:58:13.198 --> 00:58:14.491
Our goal right now

00:58:15.117 --> 00:58:17.661
is to bring Hash back safely.
Do you understand?

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.381
Mr. Yoon, here.

00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:33.802
- This looks like the place, right?
- Yes.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.556
Hash.

00:58:38.056 --> 00:58:39.016
Hash.

00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:40.517
Hash.

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.019
Turn around.

00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:46.982
Hash.

00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.361
Damn it.

00:58:51.445 --> 00:58:52.988
Hey!

00:59:02.914 --> 00:59:04.583
Good job finding this place.

00:59:04.666 --> 00:59:07.335
I thought I could trust you to come alone,

00:59:07.419 --> 00:59:08.879
so I came to welcome you.

00:59:08.962 --> 00:59:11.173
But I see you brought
your junior colleague.

00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:17.554
Yes. My name is Kang Hyo-min.

00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:19.765
I came here today

00:59:19.848 --> 00:59:22.142
because I felt bad
for making you feel uncomfortable

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.894
during our consultation last time.

00:59:24.519 --> 00:59:26.063
Seeing you like this,

00:59:26.146 --> 00:59:29.441
I think I can understand
where you're coming from.

00:59:29.524 --> 00:59:30.859
How so?

00:59:30.942 --> 00:59:32.569
We'll represent you.

00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:35.405
We'll make sure you don't go to jail.

00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:37.157
Is that possible?

00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:40.827
Didn't you come to us
because of Mr. Yoon's reputation?

00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:42.204
I did. He's really famous.

00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:45.999
But people can have differing opinions,
so I prepared a little something.

00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:47.626
It wasn't easy.

00:59:49.002 --> 00:59:50.879
But luckily, I have innocent eyes.

00:59:51.379 --> 00:59:53.632
People and animals alike
warm up to me easily.

00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.719
Am I the only one who thinks that?

00:59:57.803 --> 00:59:59.054
Don't they look innocent?

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.808
They do.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.769
Mr. Jung.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.146
Pay attention now.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.982
I can say with certainty
that Yoon Seok-hoon

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:14.486
is the only person in Korea
who can help you avoid jail time.

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:17.197
So, if you return Hash to us safely,

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.617
we'll represent you. Right, Mr. Yoon?

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.832
Thank you for offering to represent me.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.959
But I have trouble trusting people.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:32.254
So I'll hold onto Hash
until the case is settled.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:44.266
Advocacy isn't just a technical skill.
It's a comprehensive art form.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:47.602
If a lawyer is able to genuinely convey
their argument to a judge,

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:49.563
it may lead to a better outcome.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.482
If they defend you with passion,
they'll find a way.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:55.735
But with just a technical approach,
the outcome could be worse.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.905
If you continue
to hold Hash hostage like that,

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.116
genuine advocacy will not be possible.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.868
If you return Hash to us safely,

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:05.328
we will sincerely
do our best to defend you

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.955
out of gratitude.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:07.914
Right?

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:21.970
I'm touched.

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:25.640
Yeah, let's do that.
I'll be relying on you.

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:27.642
All right.

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:29.436
You'll really defend me, right?

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:35.525
Yes.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.819
You know what'll happen
if you try anything funny, right?

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.029
And what will happen to Hash.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.864
So far,

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.742
I've played with 14 dogs and 13 cats.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.535
We can't let it become 15 dogs now.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:47.704
I'll give it my all.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.207
That's more like it.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.250
Let's go.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.301
But you're not upset with me, are you?

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.429
We're on the same team now.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:06.640
We can't have any lingering resentment.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:18.526
I'm counting on you.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:36.461
I look forward to working
with you as well, Ms. Kang.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:42.676
Bye, Hash.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.303
Let's play again next time. Bye!

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:54.938
Hash.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:57.357
Hash.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:02:59.901
Hash.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:03.071
I'm sorry.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.536
I'm so sorry, Hash.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:12.497
Hash.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:36.229
Thankfully, he didn't suffer
any serious injuries,

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.398
but there's a hairline fracture
across the rib,

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:42.402
and his gastrointestinal function
is impaired due to extreme stress.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.362
The fracture isn't that severe,

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:47.324
so it should heal with rest and treatment,

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:50.535
but right now, the priority
should be psychological comfort.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.586
- My poor baby.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:00.712
Lower your voice.

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:03.840
Did you not hear her say he needs peace?

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.055
I'll take Hash tonight.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.349
Okay?

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:15.477
Okay.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.317
Yoon Seok-hoon, we need to talk.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.196
I know it's not my place,
but you should do this later.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:30.617
Mr. Yoon had a very difficult day today.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:47.842
Mr. Yoon!

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.267
LOCATION, DISTANCE

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.981
- Sir, can you take the next right?
- Sure.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.114
I'm counting on you.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.842
Here, kitties. I'm here.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.719
Come on out. Let's eat.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:47.277
So this is the security cam blind spot.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:52.031
That's right. This is the spot.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.586
You bastard.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:15.805
- What's going on there?
- Maybe he's the victim's family.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.725
The victim is an elderly person
with no known relatives.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.643
Maybe the owner of a victimized pet?

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:21.936
Probably not.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.355
He did all that
to abandoned dogs and stray cats.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:26.065
He knew that without family or owners,

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.026
he'd likely get off
with a slap on the wrist.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.111
That's why it's even more infuriating.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.488
What a piece of shit.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.406
He deserves to be beaten to a pulp.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.283
Oh, gosh.

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:36.659
Shouldn't we try to stop him?

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:38.244
Hold on. Let me finish this pastry.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:46.294
You little shit.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.089
Dad!

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.177
Dad hit Hash.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.387
It hurts so much, Dad!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.774
You messed with the wrong man.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.027
You eat all this.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:15.198
Anyone can see the dogs are suffering.

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:16.866
Damn psycho.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:21.454
Let's see how you like it.

01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.249
Hey!

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.097
Jung Wu-sol, you have
the right to remain silent.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.224
You have the right
to request a habeas corpus review

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.892
and to defend yourself.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:44.602
- Screw you.
- Stop moving!

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.896
Let me go!

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.488
Hey, Mister.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:03.204
There are security cameras that way.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:04.414
Go that way.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:08.918
That man.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.462
Why are you arresting him?

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:15.300
He beat up an elderly person
with no family, almost to death.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.218
They're at death's door.

01:08:45.079 --> 01:08:45.997
How's Hash doing?

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.457
He just fell asleep.

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:49.626
I told you to come inside.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.211
I'm fine.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.173
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

01:08:56.507 --> 01:08:57.425
Okay.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.428
What happened to you?

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:06.643
Bye.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.771
Won-jun told me.

01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:14.359
You filed a preliminary injunction?

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:16.110
Must you take it that far?

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.948
Then, am I supposed
to just let you take Hash overseas?

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:23.743
I was going to take my time
and discuss it with you.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.578
There's still a lot of time left.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.540
Won-jun just got ahead of himself
out of pettiness.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.459
Even if it's not now, it will happen.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.252
Then what am I supposed to do?

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.837
Just abandon him in Korea?

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:35.922
"Abandon him"?

01:09:36.547 --> 01:09:38.257
Leaving him with me is abandoning him?

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.217
No.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:40.843
That's not what I meant.

01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:43.596
How do I know you won't abandon Hash
all the way over there?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.931
What does that mean?

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.391
Why not?

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:48.768
You did that to your own child.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.397
How can I entrust Hash
to someone so heartless?

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:56.859
You're bringing that up now?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.863
Took you long enough.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.157
Sure, I'm heartless.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.703
I said I didn't want a baby.

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.914
I wanted it gone
the moment I got pregnant.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.794
You're unbelievable.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.381
You say that like it's nothing.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:19.924
This isn't easy for me either.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:26.222
I thought about it,
but when it came down to it,

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.101
I hesitated.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.813
I did hesitate.

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:35.773
If you hadn't, you wouldn't be human.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:40.403
I wasn't sure,
but the ultrasound signs weren't good.

01:10:42.447 --> 01:10:44.824
There was a possibility
of a neural tube defect.

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:47.618
Putting us aside,

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:50.872
what about the baby being born with that?

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:53.750
Would they be happy?

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:58.463
You should've told me.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.840
You should've told me, Yeon-a.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.342
If I had, you would've told me to have it.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:08.556
Disability or not,
whatever decision we made,

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:12.268
you would have been miserable as a result.

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:14.645
You still should've told me.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.356
You should've made me understand you.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.775
Did you ever give me a chance?

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.861
Then you should've done
what you're doing now.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.112
Called me heartless,

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.324
gotten angry, and asked me why
I did what I did.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.494
Then, I could've at least
tried to explain myself.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.622
You were busy avoiding the issue.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.918
When a parenting show came on TV,
you would change the channel on purpose.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.753
You avoided places with kids.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.088
And intimacy.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:42.757
That was…

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:46.803
for your sake. I was thinking of you.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.682
I was giving you time to heal.

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:52.850
No.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.523
No, that was so…

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:01.859
suffocating. I felt so trapped.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.654
Regardless of your intention,

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:07.240
our relationship was neglected.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.078
And we ended up in a rut.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.998
No, not for me.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.095
And to think we're just now
having this conversation.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.765
You should've just never told me.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.437
You…

01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:42.191
You are so…

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.477
YOON SEOK-HOON

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:04.941
Isn't calling back after a missed call
the polite thing to do?

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:07.026
He just ran off.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.444
I'm so worried about him.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:17.954
Maybe he's sleeping?

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:22.291
Hello? Mr. Yoon?

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.543
You weren't sleeping?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:27.463
What?

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.021
Mr. Yoon.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.737
What happened?

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.782
That looks really painful.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.618
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:13.509
Gosh, how did he even get this?

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.390
Goodness.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:25.122
BEYOND THE BAR

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:27.833
I don't want to live in a loveless family.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.586
{\an8}- This is a breach of contract.
- What kind of breach of contract?

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:33.464
{\an8}We agreed to raise our child together
without a marital relationship.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:34.924
{\an8}It denies the essence of marriage.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.467
{\an8}It's void.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:38.302
{\an8}- Let's talk for a minute.
- About what?

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:39.595
{\an8}What? Now?

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:42.723
{\an8}- What do you think you're doing?
- This is unacceptable.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.141
{\an8}You're proposing my dismissal?

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:45.601
{\an8}You need my vote.

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:47.561
{\an8}Mr. Yoon was there?

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:48.687
{\an8}Why don't you like me?

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.189
{\an8}- Seok-hoon…
- Seok-hoon?

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.774
{\an8}Just be my date tonight.

01:16:57.957 --> 01:16:59.959
