WEBVTT

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:09.075
Where do you think the soul is?

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.010
Huh?

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.114
I've operated on countless patients
and examined them internally,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.883
but I've never seen it even once.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.086
Dr. Chayasaka is a genius.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.223
There are several qualities
that make for an excellent surgeon,

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.659
such as extensive
case experience and dexterity.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:32.966
But the most important skill of all
is rational decision-making.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.503
When something unexpected
occurs during surgery,

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:40.507
a surgeon must choose
the best out of multiple paths.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:45.345
Her speed and accuracy
is what makes her great.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.253
No comment.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:58.324
Do you know who scouted
Uotora's biggest star?

00:00:58.992 --> 00:00:59.993
That's me!

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.795
Me!

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.064
Thanks to me,
the Cardiovascular Department

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.832
has received a lot of bookings.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.567
How exciting!

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.772
I told you,
I'll go to another hospital tomorrow!

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.041
- I'm not in pain anymore!
- Lie down--

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.342
Let me out of here!

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.911
No abnormalities on the X-ray.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.712
- Hey…
- Please lie down.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.052
Could you kick your feet a bit?

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.153
What?

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.056
Huh?

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.125
Can you feel me?

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.629
No feeling due to motor paralysis.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.665
It's pale…

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.967
Loss of pulse.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.703
Please give me a minute.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.139
A 47-year-old man

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.309
came in with acute pain
in his left lower limb.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.079
The five Ps were all present,
such as paralysis and pulselessness.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:01:59.919
Okay.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:04.457
Can you check if the leg
was really where the pain started.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.494
And if he has a record
of high blood pressure or diabetes?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.529
Your mother is a tea ceremony master.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.731
Has that helped your surgical skills any?

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.199
Not at all.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.669
Excuse me.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.272
Toda speaking.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.174
- Is it an emergency?
- Yes.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:22.942
- But…
- Understood.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.679
Relax. My résumé is pretty impressive,
no matter how you look at it.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.149
I knew it, no atrial fibrillation.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.717
How did you know?

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.353
The monitor beeped regularly
over the phone.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.789
You could tell just over the phone?

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.558
The CT scans are in.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.267
My leg isn't hurting anymore.
I want to go home.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.201
You can't, sir.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:51.437
You've been diagnosed
with aortic dissection.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.107
Huh? Who the hell are you,
showing up out of nowhere?

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.976
- I'm out of here!
- Please stop moving!

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.044
Wait…

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.815
A specialist will now explain
everything to you.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.485
You can go home if you want.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.655
But… from the looks of it,

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.590
there's an 80% chance you'll die.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.426
- Die?
- But you're lucky!

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.962
I'm a super cardiac expert.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.232
I've treated many patients
with what you have,

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.701
including some who didn't make it.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.469
Leave it to me!

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.074
Quit flirting with the monitor.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.642
Sorry, Doc.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.711
The survival rate drops by the hour.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.415
We must cut now,
or the base of his heart might burst.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:44.023
Man, I'm so glad you were around,
Dr. Chayasaka.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.260
{\an8}As well as Dr. Tokushige.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:50.463
He handles everything so smoothly,
like with the scan,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.832
it's as though he can
predict your next move.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.802
Are all general physicians like that?

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:59.639
You know something,
the General Medicine Department…

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:03.476
{\an8}Akira Tokushige, General Physician.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.480
I wonder how many people are actually
interested in going into General Medicine.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:12.619
The state seems to be promoting it,
yet taxes on healthcare are decreasing.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.521
No one will come to our rescue.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.458
It's up to us to defend our hospital.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.793
The Director is also
aware of that, isn't he?

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:26.966
I'm not interested in politics,
so I'll pass on the complicated stuff.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.701
This concerns Uotora's future--

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:29.669
But…!

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:34.507
Why is the Director so supportive of him?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:40.213
What does that nice guy
with the glasses have?

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.816
That intrigues me a little.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.765
{\an8}"Uotora Hospital…

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.566
{\an8}part-time physician."

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.937
Seven years ago,
he served as an ER doctor for some time.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.844
There are two types of revolutionaries.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.546
Revolutionaries?

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:15.381
Messengers of justice.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.517
And…

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.119
charlatans.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.125
I wonder which one he is.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.263
Good morning.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.907
GENERAL MEDICINE

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.117
I heard you were very helpful last night.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.485
Not at all.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.455
But I'm glad he was able
to have the surgery right away.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.258
Don't get too far ahead.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:03.229
If General Medicine earns more,
it will make my department stand out.

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.499
We can't have that.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:17.276
Shall we begin?

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:19.912
{\an8}We don't need Toda.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.948
{\an8}It's drinks with those
from our year, right?

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.549
Is that day still bugging you?

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.650
Hell no!

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.120
There's no way an elite
would want to drink with us.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:30.490
He's directly under Chayasaka,
the Queen of Hearts.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:33.993
What?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.963
I don't hate the sound of
"Queen of Hearts." So, I'll forgive it.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.799
But you're in my way, so go away.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:40.700
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:44.337
Dr. Chayasaka,
I'd like to observe a surgery.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.641
Can you guess what
the biggest waste of time in life is?

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:49.675
Huh?

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.744
Worrying about others.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:56.983
CARDIO SURGERY
TRAINING ROOM

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.419
You got a death wish!
That was irreverent of you.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.922
After Dr. Osu…

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.491
it could be your turn.

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.427
Turn for what?

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:13.232
Dr. Chayasaka has her eye on you.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.401
You'll have a hard time.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:19.639
It's a great thing to have someone
from another department

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.040
show interest in me.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.877
General Medicine is finally
starting to take shape.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.713
She’s more tenacious than a snake.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.848
A snake?

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:32.118
She always follows
anyone she's interested in around,

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.921
but won't say anything about herself.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.658
We know little about her
besides her flashy career.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.028
Does she even go home?

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.130
That's if she even has one.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.202
If she doesn't open up about herself,

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:52.839
we'll never really understand her.

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.106
Yeah.

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.777
Have you heard about Taku?

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:58.945
No.

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.215
He plans to take the equivalency exam,

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.851
{\an8}yet he hasn't told his father about it.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.087
Can't even tell his family.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.591
Maybe because they're family.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.826
But who knows?

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:27.907
I have an ashtray.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.452
{\an8}MATSUKAGE STYLE TEA HOUSE

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.007
You could have just mailed it
if you wanted my seal.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.679
That'd be too much trouble.

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.288
How is it at the hospital?

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:16.989
It's all surgery.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:18.991
I do nothing but cut.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:32.104
I've gotten used to you
not doing what I want you to do.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.616
Won't you stay for some tea?

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.588
I've forgotten it all.

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.298
{\an8}"Once I start studying for exams,

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:01.701
{\an8}I'll have to cut back on my part-time job.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:05.104
{\an8}I'm not sure
if I really need this or not."

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:09.642
It's scary to live for yourself, isn't it?

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.348
He says that every time
he tries to make a move,

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.083
his younger self appears to him.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.052
"Can I really say that?"

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.357
"I must not be selfish and cause trouble."

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:26.892
Taku…

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.962
{\an8}He's moving forward.

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:35.134
If he has become aware of his inner child,

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:39.572
then maybe he has
moved on to reassuring that child.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:46.112
Yes?

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:47.246
You have a delivery.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.981
- Oh?
- Thank you!

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.617
It's so heavy!

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.386
There are ten more boxes.

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:54.920
- Huh?
- What?

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.456
They're from Dr. Akaike.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.333
{\an8}DO IT. - YOUR MENTOR

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.901
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:14.540
Seriously, who doesn't hate being on call?

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.743
Some things can only be enjoyed
by experiencing them live.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.878
That may be so.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:22.481
Your good friend, Dr. Chayasaka,
and I will be live with you tonight.

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.287
But I don't really get her.

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.824
It's like she can't
keep a conversation going.

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.426
And she sees others…

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.362
as insects.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.436
I guess geniuses are just like that?

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:45.471
Yum.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:53.979
This is for the other day.

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:00.519
Do you think eel and shibazuke
are good enough?

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:02.822
Come on.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.590
It's delicious.

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:06.892
In that case…

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:11.931
How about this or this?

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.899
STEAMED BREAD WITH EGG
BREAD STICKS WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:14.834
And this?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.002
Looks like a boys' sports club lineup.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.339
I was in the cultural clubs.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.441
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.243
Is it that surprising?

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.345
No. Remember that patient?

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:30.750
You pinned him down so naturally,
I thought you had done martial arts.

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:34.186
You don't say! I'm terrible at sports.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.354
Then, how?

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.556
How, you ask?

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:41.627
Must be from my ER days.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:46.565
I'd often deal with drunk people
and those in a panic.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:48.467
- I naturally picked it up.
- Wait…

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.536
You used to work in the ER?

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.938
Yes, at the Mitsuzawa University Hospital.

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:57.042
But it seems my body still remembers.

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.112
Why?

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:01.547
Hm?

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.483
Why did you move to General Medicine?

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.384
Yeah.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.553
Why…

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:11.357
Why…

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:13.959
Was there maybe a patient
you couldn't forget?

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:15.494
No…

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.030
Sorry.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:23.903
It would be cool to have
a clear turning point that led me to it,

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.005
but that's not the case.

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.140
It just…

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:31.010
sort of came to me.

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:36.582
I felt an overwhelming passion
to treat patients till the very end.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:38.851
That's when I came upon it.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.719
That's all.

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:44.423
Really?

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.059
{\an8}He sent some to General Medicine too?

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.696
{\an8}It was you who introduced
Dr. Tokushige to Dr. Akaike.

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:52.498
- Am I right, sir?
- Yes.

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:55.768
It was when he worked here
at Uotora as a part-timer.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.137
The patients I save…

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:01.607
I wonder how they're doing now.

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:06.145
Are they doing well,

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:09.648
or are they still hurting?

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.621
I don't know anything about them.

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:19.892
His words really struck me.

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:24.797
In today's medical world,
that's just wishful thinking…

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.065
an ideal.

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:31.270
But dreams will go to waste
if no one pursues them!

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.941
Someone has to wave the flag.

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:41.213
If that's what it takes,
I don't mind being the fool.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.688
Sorry, it wasn't that interesting.

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:55.227
An ER doctor's task is to keep
the heart beating, no matter what.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.229
Yes.

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.532
The same goes for us at Cardiovascular.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.770
Treating organs,
doing all it takes to save patients…

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:08.274
Such doctors are old-fashioned!

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:10.643
Old-fashioned?

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:12.278
General physicians…

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:16.215
I mean, doctors like you…

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.485
May make some doctors feel

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.689
their medical practices
are being dismissed.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:27.559
Dismissed?

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.530
Their medical practices?

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:36.835
What?

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:41.540
Do you feel that way, too?

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.443
That I'm dismissing your practices?

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:53.786
I believe that both types
of doctors are necessary.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:03.095
My time in the ER remains precious to me.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:04.930
But…

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.500
I couldn't take my eyes off

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.270
the path I wanted to take.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.241
You're selfish.

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:18.377
Yes.

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:22.681
I'm quite selfish.

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:31.824
Making eye contact
makes people feel secure.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:33.559
I'll rephrase that.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.594
Repeating the patient's words

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:39.898
has the effect of helping them
organize their feelings and thoughts.

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:41.967
And…

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.004
Mirroring?

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.172
Mimicking movements.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:50.576
Achieving intimacy and harmony
at an unconscious level,

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:53.779
to tell the person you engage
that you're not their enemy.

00:16:56.515 --> 00:17:00.486
Caring for patients
is all about technique.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.555
Insincere kindness.

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:06.258
Insincere?

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.739
Bingo!

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:26.078
Not many people can see through me.

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.781
You see the big picture.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.818
Seeing all from a bird's eye view.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:33.719
What?

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.421
Oh, my.

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.356
I had fun!

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:38.690
Hey…

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:40.225
Oh, sorry.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.428
What do we have?

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:46.098
Suspected acute aortic dissection,
barely conscious upon retrieval.

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.566
Cerebral ischemia?

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:50.469
She said her daughter works at Uotora.

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:51.937
- Her daughter?
- Yes.

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.372
This way, please.

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.279
{\an8}AI CHAYASAKA, AGE 68

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:01.413
{\an8}Chayasaka…

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.450
Is it an aortic dissection?

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:05.984
Yes.

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.989
Is there a vacant OR?

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:11.890
Let's go.

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:13.092
Uh… yes.

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.460
Wait!

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.897
We don't operate on family members
on ethical grounds.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:21.934
Then, who'll do it?

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:30.909
He's never done a solo surgery
and you expect me to assign him this?

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:34.646
Just get your neuro dad down here!

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.648
She's barely conscious.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:38.617
I wouldn't…

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.389
perform surgery on my dad.

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:47.259
So?

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:50.863
Your judgement will be impaired.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.700
Let's go.

00:18:57.503 --> 00:19:01.440
Family or not, a heart is still a heart.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.476
{\an8}Dr. Chayasaka is performing
her mother's surgery?

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:12.084
Her vitals are stable.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.452
Artificial blood vessel size?

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.720
28.

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:16.588
I set aside a 26 just in case.

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.523
Okay.

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:20.359
Let's do this.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.495
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.130
Scalpel.

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:41.880
- If I stop… the water will get cold.
- If you stop the water will get cold.

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.316
Fold the fukusa cloth.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.052
Hold the ladle.

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:50.355
You can't master it
if you still need to think about it.

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:54.960
Keep practicing and practicing
until your body

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.696
naturally remembers.

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:22.087
During a tea ceremony,

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:26.825
your hands have to act
ahead of your thoughts.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:27.960
Unclamping.

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:33.365
One step at a time,
without mixing them up.

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.101
You can't stop.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.605
Cooper scissors.

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.609
Check the ACT.

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.611
ACT is at 338.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.314
Is the graft complete?

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.817
All replacements have been made.

00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.052
I'm about to take her off bypass.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:31.290
The Queen of Hearts…

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.828
Good morning.

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:14.099
Where…

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.470
am I?

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.172
The hospital.

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.444
Doctor…

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:27.979
Doctor…

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:32.517
My daughter.

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:36.621
Get her here.

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.626
My daugh--

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:44.062
Come in.

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:46.765
Excuse me, sir.

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:55.440
Should I take my coat off?

00:22:56.908 --> 00:23:00.379
You're speaking to me
as the patient's family, right?

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.426
The left frontal lobe.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:17.529
There's still ischemia
in the precentral gyrus.

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:20.298
Based on her current response
and physical findings,

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:24.536
your mother's right side
remains paralyzed.

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:27.305
She's also experiencing memory loss.

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:29.775
It'll be hard for her
to live independently.

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:32.878
So, she can't be left alone?

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:36.047
Are you going to go on leave?

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:39.017
You need time to think it over.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:43.355
We have a care plan
that works with home care services.

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:46.758
Facilities are also an option.

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.795
I never thought I would be told

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:53.432
that I had the option of giving up
my career as a cardiac surgeon.

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:57.803
She has no one else to turn to.
It's just the two of you.

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:02.340
You're actually kind, Dr. Togo.

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:07.746
So the revolutionary…

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.714
is Director Kitano.

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:13.919
He wasn't deceived by Dr. Tokushige.

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:17.355
But you know that already.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.926
A facility application form, please.

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:24.229
Surgeons must be able
to make quick decisions.

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:26.731
Right?

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:31.336
For higher brain dysfunction
and hemiplegia patients,

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.905
we provide round-the-clock
recovery care experts.

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.342
The environment… It's a small
group of people, and the staff--

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:39.511
Do I sign here?

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:40.412
What?

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:41.813
Oh, yes.

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.820
{\an8}PATIENT'S NAME: AI CHAYASAKA

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:51.423
You're really…

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.526
gone down the path
I didn't want you to go.

00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:55.894
{\an8}REPRESENTATIVE: KOKORO…

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:14.846
Doctor.

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:16.248
If you please.

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:26.491
No. This would cause it to detach.

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:27.592
Yes, doctor.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:31.997
Please get…

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:34.966
my daughter here.

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:51.349
Could you reach out to Dr. Chayasaka?

00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:54.853
She wouldn't admit it,
but it's definitely affected her.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.157
It's gotten to the point
where she can't hide it anymore.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:03.328
She's trying to ignore
that part of herself.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:07.432
Uotora needs her and her team.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:09.267
Yes, sir.

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:15.140
Please examine her,
as a general physician.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.312
Understood.

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:30.355
Excuse me.

00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:43.268
I'm here to talk
with Ms. Kokoro Chayasaka.

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.476
I'm Akira Tokushige, General Physician.

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:55.380
Interesting.

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:01.419
I happen to have time to spare.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.658
What will you do?

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:10.061
You can't fool me with cheap tricks.

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:13.765
Insincere kindness will backfire.

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:15.634
I might close myself off.

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.670
I'm aware of that.

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:21.039
So today,

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:25.243
let's talk with all our cards
out in the open.

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:28.346
Out in the open?

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.215
Yes.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.896
HERE LIE MY THOUGHTS
AS A GENERAL PHYSICIAN

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:49.801
{\an8}"A general physician's consultation…"

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:51.136
First off,

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:56.141
Dr. Chayasaka, this movement
I've seen you do over and over…

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:02.447
By tracing your movements,

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:05.550
we can find clues
that point to a diagnosis.

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:11.022
Do you have a headache?

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:19.397
No?

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:23.601
In that case,
it's not a biological problem.

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:28.406
Thus, it's either psychological or social.

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:31.142
Huh?

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:34.879
{\an8}"A general physician's consultation
is different from counseling…"

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:37.982
Which is simply listening to the patient.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.485
{\an8}It involves using various methods

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:44.322
{\an8}to diagnose illnesses
and guide patients toward treatment.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:48.993
{\an8}Dr. Chayasaka, you are aware
of these three words, are you not?

00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:53.198
Biological, psychological, social.

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:56.367
Body, mind, and society?

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.535
That's correct.

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:03.508
These three factors interact
to cause physical and mental problems.

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:09.647
It is from these three angles
that general physicians examine patients.

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.183
And?

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.918
And now,

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:19.958
let us look at your situation
from a social angle.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.164
You are an excellent
cardiovascular surgeon.

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:30.468
You have a long, distinguished career.

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:34.939
Moreover, you have a mission
to train young doctors.

00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:38.543
That is something
you cannot allow to come to an end.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.715
Because it is something
that only you can do.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.452
Let us look at it…

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.022
from a psychological angle.

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:57.395
You are your mother's only daughter.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.133
You're worried
about leaving her on her own.

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:04.002
ONLY DAUGHTER
WORRY

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.737
Is that what you're thinking?

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.741
Worried?

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:20.218
Carry on.

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:26.157
To be a doctor, or a daughter.

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.061
Now,

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:33.932
you must choose one of them.

00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:42.073
Putting things off
won't solve the problem.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.708
I know that!

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:50.348
You know that?

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:51.916
- But…
- But?

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:06.998
You are currently confronting
an issue about your own life.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:11.536
However, it appears to me…

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.107
that you're unable to face it calmly.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.180
I'm unable to face myself?

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:32.790
Face myself?

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.897
Shall we stop here?

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:42.000
What?

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:43.968
I'm sorry.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:48.006
I think I've put you through enough.

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.075
Let's talk another day.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:01.986
She's my mother!

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.492
She's your mother?

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:13.765
I can't cut her out.

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:20.805
I can't just abandon her, can I?

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:23.608
If…

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.344
If I did that…

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:32.483
I'll be yelled at.

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.230
Yelled at?

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:51.970
By whom?

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:56.140
Mom.

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:57.408
I'm sorry.

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:58.910
I'm sorry.

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.081
So…

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:08.820
will you take care
of your mother on your own?

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:11.122
I mean…

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:14.359
it's the right thing to do.

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.030
As human beings,

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:24.669
we have a need for rules
like ethics and morals.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:30.008
However, if we let them consume us,

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:33.611
telling us how we should live,

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.215
or how to be good children,

00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:41.519
they become shackles that bind us.

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.793
The tighter they bind us,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.499
the stronger we may resist or fight back.

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.842
I hate you, Mom.

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:08.579
I hate you so much.

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:13.584
You're not Mr. Nice Doctor, after all.

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:23.261
You're making me face things
I don't want to.

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:28.966
I thought,

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.437
Dr. Chayasaka,

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:37.742
you might have been
struggling with something

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.511
you can't confront.

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:47.552
And what that something is,

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:53.424
you should already know.

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.604
Therefore…

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:14.312
Ms. Kokoro Chayasaka.

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:21.085
Please tell me…

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.322
your story.

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.195
My mother…

00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:33.865
kept telling me,

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.835
"Why are you like this?"

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.472
"This is for your own good."

00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:55.286
My mother…

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:57.788
- Not like this.
- She was strict.

00:35:57.855 --> 00:36:00.291
Extend your elbow. Good.

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:01.325
Okay.

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:04.562
Why can't you do as you are told?

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.198
I'm sorry.

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:14.605
I'm sorry!

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:15.606
I'm sorry!

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:19.377
Next time, work harder
and get a perfect score.

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:21.379
This is for your own good.

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:26.551
When she caught me smoking
for the first time.

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.954
I'll never forget the look she gave me.

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.422
Why?

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:34.759
I'm an adult.

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:38.963
How could you do this?

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:43.601
You've really gone down
the path I didn't want you to go.

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:48.439
Nothing was said after that.

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:50.808
How "lucky" for me.

00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:59.417
If only there were a clearer reason.

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.722
We just don't get along.

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:08.392
You don't get along?

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:12.597
I can't answer her "whys" and "how comes."

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:18.803
Little by little, feelings weighed us down

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.439
until they just burst.

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:26.077
And we became like this.

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.385
As mother and child,

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:39.890
your blood ties help you
to understand each other.

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:44.362
But that may just be a fantasy.

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:51.002
Being family…

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.940
doesn't mean it's best
for you to live life together.

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:01.512
But, Mom needs help now.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:07.418
I can't bear to see her all alone.

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.624
This happened…

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:19.397
because I wasn't a good child.

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:22.967
I…

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:32.777
was an awful daughter.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.714
It's possible,

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:42.820
your mother went through a difficult time.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:50.194
But, that's all on her.

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:58.169
You don't have to take the blame for that.

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:03.974
You've been…

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:21.492
hurting yourself to such an extent
for someone else's sake.

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:26.630
That makes you…

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:30.101
a very nice person.

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.481
Are you hurting?

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:52.323
I can't bring myself to hate her.

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:00.498
If you take a step back,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.002
you will see things more clearly.

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:13.511
If you want to get closer to her again,

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.615
you should be able to do that.

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:29.627
I have a question.

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:35.166
Go ahead.

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:39.703
I'll ask…

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:42.773
once it's all over.

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:51.482
Mom.

00:40:56.654 --> 00:41:00.157
I can't live with you.

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:06.330
I'm sorry.

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:08.732
I'm an awful daughter.

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:20.478
Thank you.

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.687
My heart…

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.493
Thank you for saving me.

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.403
Thank you.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.531
Answer me.

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:15.733
Yes?

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:22.673
Where do you think the soul is?

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:25.776
Hmm…

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:29.847
I don't think we have one.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:38.155
That's because, medically speaking,
there's no such organ as a soul.

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:42.927
What a terrible answer.

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.731
Nevertheless, people still connect.

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:59.643
When you see someone you like,
your chest pounds.

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:02.813
When someone hurts you,

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:05.549
your eyes well up.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.224
{\an8}Between us,

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:19.063
{\an8}a soul is formed.

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:22.633
{\an8}That's what I believe.

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.820
{\an8}Care for some sushi?

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.321
{\an8}Sounds good.

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:46.924
{\an8}When is a good time?

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:48.192
{\an8}Now, of course.

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.427
{\an8}- What?
- Sorry.

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.529
{\an8}I have plans today.

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.164
{\an8}- What? Hey!
- If you'll excuse me.

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:59.336
{\an8}We plan to renovate this area
to integrate the operating room and ICU.

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.907
{\an8}Impressive as always.

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:09.013
{\an8}This is our chance
to taste cutting-edge medical care!

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:11.515
{\an8}I've made up my mind.

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.653
{\an8}I'm running in the next director election.

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.336
{\an8}It seems Dr. Chayasaka made up her mind.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:35.139
{\an8}Yes.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.908
{\an8}You spoke with her.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.581
{\an8}How nice of you.

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:57.261
A patient here gave me these.

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.097
It's against the rules.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.034
But…

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.538
Life can't be all bitter.

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:11.608
At times, we could use a little sweetness.

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:33.030
Let me go…

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.032
home.

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:38.502
Let me…

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.373
go home…

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:46.910
Stage four, lung cancer.

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:49.179
There's nothing more the hospital can do.

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.581
He has requested home care.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.883
Can I assign him to you?

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.886
I have one foot in the grave.

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:59.723
I'd always been praying
for my patients' future. But…

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.024
That's enough!

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.626
Dad is fighting so hard…

00:46:02.693 --> 00:46:04.695
That's what it is to die.

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:05.896
What can we do?

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:09.133
{\an8}The answer lies in the time
you'll spend together from now on.

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.134
