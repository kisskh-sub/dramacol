00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.180
It is because…

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.766
Is he…

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:01.019
I have begun to see you as a woman.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.983
It is because I am pleased with the food
you prepare for me.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:08.651
What?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.489
Why did you turn away from me to say that?

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.450
Because I…

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.367
Why…

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:17.911
- Well…
- What?

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:19.287
Why are you walking away from me?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.580
- Because I…
- Why…

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:48.942
That was your fault.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.027
If you had stopped coming toward me,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.279
I would not have fallen down.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.283
Why are you so angry about it?
It's no big deal.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.036
I'm fine.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.831
I scraped my palm.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:04.249
Let me see.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.295
This is not just a scrape.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.223
I must summon the royal physician.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.600
Your Majesty.

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:25.353
You get cuts and scrapes like this
all the time in the royal kitchen.

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:26.896
I'm really okay.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.693
Is that so? I did not know.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.282
I shall inform those in the royal kitchen
to dull all the knives.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.159
No, it's fine.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.244
I got my handbag back,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.621
so I'm going to go back now.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.168
What do you mean you will go back
now that you have found your handybag?

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.838
Inside this handbag…

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.632
What is inside the handybag?

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.302
Mangunrok's inside.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.437
Where did it go?

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.188
Wait.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.611
What? My phone's gone too.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:15.862
My Mangunrok.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.197
My Mangunrok!

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.532
Calm down, Cook Yeon.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.201
There was no book inside the handybag.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.996
Where did you find this?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.998
Song-jae gave it to me.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.041
Song-jae?

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.460
The Chief Royal Secretary?

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.341
There was no book
inside the handybag when I received it.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.634
Are you sure about that?

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.720
Your Majesty,
I would not dare to lie to you.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.722
That can't be.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.016
I swear it was in here.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.062
If you're keeping it,
please just give it to me already.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.230
I said I do not know of it.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.315
I would return it immediately if I knew.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.192
Oh no.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.236
Cook Yeon.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.489
I think the book fell out and landed

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.742
somewhere in Salgoji Forest
when the handybag flew over the cliff.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.660
Look.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.454
My lipstick, pouch,
passport, and wallet are all here,

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:07.580
so why would only the book disappear?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.291
If not that, then why else would that be
the only thing missing?

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:12.710
Think about it.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.421
What would the Chief Royal Secretary gain
from keeping it?

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.842
You never know.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.386
I told you clearly I did not take it.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.181
Then how about this?

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:27.892
Once the envoys leave,

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.312
I will send my troops
to search the forest for the book.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.189
If they still cannot find it,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.942
I will issue an order all over the country
and offer a reward for the book.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.027
What do you think?

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.822
Do you promise?

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.284
Your Majesty.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.495
I'm serious. I need to go back home.

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:49.539
I have to go back to the future.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.500
Very well.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.003
I understand
how desperately you seek this book,

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.671
so I will find it for you by any means.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:58.923
Okay.

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:02.719
I guess I'll have to wait a bit more then.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:20.028
ROYAL KITCHEN

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.822
Ever heard of seoktanhyang,
the scent of seoktanju?

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.118
It is said that after tasting this liquor,
His Majesty said,

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.371
"It is so sweet and fragrant

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:34.417
that I wish to keep it in my mouth
and never swallow."

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.210
MAENG MAN-SU
EIGHTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.128
SIM MAK-JIN
ASSISTANT COOK

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.296
Enough talking.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.965
Let us raise our bowls
for the royal kitchen.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.551
- To the royal kitchen!
- To the royal kitchen!

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.189
You are here.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.273
You are here, miss.

00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:00.068
Look who is here.

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.278
It is our chief royal cook.

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.614
Yes. I'm a bit late, aren't I?

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.659
What's this smell?

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.455
Were you drinking?

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.458
- I do not smell anything.
- Well… Wait.

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:18.920
This is liquor.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.882
Cook Eom happened to brew
some good liquor,

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.510
- so we were tasting it.
- That is right.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.678
{\an8}This is called seoktanju.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.931
{\an8}I let it ferment for seven days,

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:33.351
{\an8}and I opened the pot today
to just have a taste.

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:38.439
Since we got caught anyway,

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:44.070
would you like to have a taste yourself?

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:47.323
Right, miss. Just have a taste.

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.784
Are you not able to hold your liquor?

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:52.662
I mean, I can drink, but…

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:03.339
What on earth

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:07.718
Am I trying so hard to find?

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:12.473
Where on earth

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:15.476
Am I flowing without rest?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.061
No, wait!

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:21.190
There's no rhythm.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.651
While I sing…

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.073
You should tap the beat for me!

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.411
I once saw the end of my life

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:35.872
My heart grew tight

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.874
What stopped me from living

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.042
Was the fear I had about my tomorrow

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.753
Gosh, she reeks of liquor.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.256
In those long and repeated days

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:48.050
I saw my abandoned self

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.761
- Oh, the smell.
- I wasn't there

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.098
And neither was my Mangunrok

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.893
You must come back home

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.269
Everybody!

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.527
Come, come, come, come back home

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:10.615
Where is the missing Mangunrok?

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:16.204
I will go back

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:20.208
COURSE N° 6 BLACK SESAME MACARON

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:37.308
{\an8}- Miss, you are awake.
- Oh, my head…

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:43.105
{\an8}Gil-geum. Why am I here?

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:44.941
{\an8}The seoksura!

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:45.983
{\an8}Do not worry.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:49.862
{\an8}His Majesty commanded Cook Eom
to prepare tonight's evening meal.

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.072
{\an8}Oh, okay.

00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:56.077
{\an8}Did something bad happen to you?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.954
"Mangunrok."

00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.997
"Mangunrok."

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.958
"Oh no, my Mangunrok!"

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.210
You kept saying that
and cried your eyes out.

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:06.879
- Do you even remember?
- Well…

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.511
Gil-geum, so I got my handbag back--

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:14.679
But Mangunrok was missing?

00:09:14.762 --> 00:09:15.972
How do you know that?

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.474
You got drunk and kept saying that

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.893
until it made our ears bleed.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.520
Oh, I see.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.944
I thought I'd be able to go home.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.697
What should I do now?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.116
Why are you worried?

00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:38.369
You said His Majesty
promised to find it for you.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:39.287
My gosh!

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.163
I even told you about that?

00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:44.417
This makes it the 35th time.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.087
Anyway, if His Majesty is helping you out,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.464
I am sure you will find it somehow.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.011
Oh, I don't know. I'm going to sleep.

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:58.139
So give it some time and be patient.

00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:01.475
Where on earth is it?

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.322
She will go back to where she came from?

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.281
Your Majesty.

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:17.908
I'm serious. I need to go back home.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.244
I have to go back to the future.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.248
Just where

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.210
does she keep saying she will go?

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:32.214
What future?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.845
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.644
So you are telling me

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:48.606
the Ming envoy refuses to eat Joseon food?

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:49.940
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.817
That is the message
I received from Minister Yoo,

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.695
who is in Yangju
as the reception official.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.489
Seeing that they are finding fault
with the food

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.741
that has been prepared with care,
saying it is not to their liking,

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.577
is it not obvious
that they are trying to make extra demands

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.122
under the pretext of our neglecting to
welcome the envoy in an appropriate way?

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:08.042
What did we send to the Ming
with the previous envoy?

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:13.714
Fine silk, ramie fabric, white paper,
woven sedge mats, sable fur, otter fur,

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:18.177
horses from Jeju,
and peregrine falcons, Your Majesty.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.179
We did not send any ginseng, I see.

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.599
Is that what this is about?

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.394
Your Majesty, we seek your advice.

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:30.731
How about we serve Ming food
that the envoys are accustomed to?

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.234
There are some Han people
who are skilled in cooking

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:35.069
in the Chinese clan village.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.822
No.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.451
Let them starve.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.537
Pardon?

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.790
Let them starve?

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.585
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:54.088
I fear that would provide them
with just the excuse they are looking for.

00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:55.339
He is right.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.591
If we do starve them,
they might once again force us

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.718
to purchase worthless objects from them.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.388
How can you conduct diplomacy
with such timidity?

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.890
His Majesty is right.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.308
Fellow ministers.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.727
Rather than wasting time worrying,

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:11.605
- we ought to come up with a plan.
- He is right.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.567
As His Majesty said,
we could lose what is in our best interest

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.193
if we only focus on appeasing the envoys.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:17.445
Silence!

00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:23.617
I was told he brought
as many as three cooks,

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:25.494
so I doubt he will actually starve.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.997
Regardless of their plan,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.458
we must not act
according to their intentions.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.001
Do you understand?

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:35.546
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.506
Let us conclude the morning assembly.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.884
Be sure to strictly follow protocol.

00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:42.428
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:58.736
What on earth is His Majesty thinking?

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:02.823
It would be inappropriate not to serve
any food at all, would it not?

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.034
- Exactly.
- "Let them starve."

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:09.288
I would never have imagined
hearing such an answer.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.875
But surely you do not believe
His Majesty intends for us to starve them?

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.211
We are told to follow protocol,

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.254
{\an8}so let us prepare the hamayeon with care.

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.464
{\an8}HAMAYEON: BANQUET HELD BY THE KING
UPON THE ENVOY'S ARRIVAL

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:20.090
{\an8}Very well!

00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:23.260
Shall we go, Father?

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.472
My goodness. What do you expect us to do?

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:30.392
The Ming envoys and their entourage
have finally reached the palace.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.019
Quickly prepare some refreshments.

00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:34.980
They barely ate because Joseon food
is not to their taste.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.691
I need you to do your best, Cook Yeon.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.902
Our food was not to their taste?

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:43.072
Did they really starve
throughout the entire journey?

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.198
That is what I heard.

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:45.741
I heard that the chief envoy

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:48.536
is a eunuch renowned in the Ming
for his refined palate.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.205
So we should take particular care
in preparing and serving his food.

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.374
- He's a eunuch?
- Yes.

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:56.043
The chief envoy visiting us
is of great influence,

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:57.920
who has practically raised
the current emperor

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.380
since he was a crown prince.

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:01.882
Surely he would have tasted
delicacies from around the world.

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:03.300
In that case,

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:07.221
I'd better serve something
he has never tasted before.

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:09.515
- Is there such a thing?
- Yes.

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:12.560
I'm not sure if he'll like it,

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:14.270
but something just came to mind.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.313
That is truly a relief.

00:14:16.397 --> 00:14:18.732
Even so, I am still concerned.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:22.736
I hear that this chief envoy
is ill-tempered.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.405
I heard that as well.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.073
For entertainment's sake,

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:27.908
he has incredibly skilled cooks
of the Ming

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:33.455
partake in a cooking competition
against Joseon cooks.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.958
I see you heard that rumor as well.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.710
Uiju, Pyeongyang, Yangju.

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:40.379
They competed against Joseon cooks
in every region they passed through

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:42.798
and humiliated them.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.691
{\an8}TAEPYEONGGWAN

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:06.238
The long journey must have been tedious.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:10.242
I heard that the food of Joseon
was not to your liking,

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.702
which gave you quite a hard time.

00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:24.965
He has brought cooks from the Ming,
and fortunately, has not gone hungry.

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.844
They must be some impressive cooks.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.936
They not only serve as cooks
but also as bodyguards.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.270
First…

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.857
Firstly, of the three Ming cooks,

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.817
this person is the equivalent
of a chief royal cook.

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:47.488
He is the last descendant of the
Sichuan Tang clan, famed for martial arts,

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.782
which was annihilated a century
ago for treason.

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:53.369
He is a legendary cook
who challenged and beat

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.330
all the famous inns in China
and took their signboards.

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.381
He is the master of Sichuan fare,

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.174
Tang Bailong.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.387
Isn't that what you'd expect
to read in a novel?

00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.308
It's like a story
straight out of a martial arts novel.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.352
Anyway, continue.

00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:19.353
The next person

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:22.231
is Tang Bailong's niece and pupil.

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:25.526
I heard she combines Sichuan food
with foods from other regions

00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:27.987
to create a new tradition.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.030
Simply put…

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.161
She is the fairy of Sichuan fare,
Ya Feixiu.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:40.499
That would practically make her
a food researcher.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:47.423
Next up is the most mysterious cook,
who is said to be Confucius' descendant.

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.425
Of the four great branches
of Chinese fare,

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.844
he is the master of Shandong fare.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.763
They say his cooking skills
are as precise as his knife

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.807
and just as delectable.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.936
{\an8}KUNG FU FARE: CUISINE OF CONFUCIUS FAMILY
SERVED TO THE EMPEROR

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:04.648
He is the Shandong kung fu fare expert,
Kong Wenli.

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.359
That's enough material
for a whole cooking movie.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.405
Well, I have to admit, I'm intrigued.

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:15.242
They must all be really impressive cooks.

00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:17.661
Cooks like me
who have only studied briefly abroad

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:20.789
are nothing compared to cooks
who live and breathe the fare.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.626
Will you be able to manage?

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:28.422
I'm suddenly reminded of an old saying.

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.967
"There's nothing much to eat at feasts
that are the talk of the town."

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.511
There's no time. Let's go.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.888
- Come on, hurry.
- Okay.

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:47.149
He says his cooks

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:50.110
will show you, a gourmet,
truly delectable delicacies.

00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:53.614
Thank you. I look forward to it.

00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:57.618
Tell him that I also have
a special chief royal cook.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.705
And that the taste of true Joseon food

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:04.416
will be available for them to enjoy.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.012
He has already heard
about the gwinyeo cook.

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:20.516
He is curious.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.936
You will soon get a taste.

00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:29.691
Shall we go inside?

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:46.834
This is the secret weapon
for the refreshment we'll be making.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:48.252
It's butter.

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:51.964
Batter?

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:53.757
Botto?

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.175
Balta?

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.301
Butta?

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:02.474
Will this be enough
to captivate the envoys?

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:06.103
Nothing beats something sweet
when you want to lighten the mood.

00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:07.980
I'm sure the envoys are tired

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.983
after the long trip to get here.

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:13.569
Let's see if something sweet
will work its magic on them.

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.362
How do you make this?

00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:17.239
You make it by boiling cow's milk

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:20.367
and collecting the curds
that form on the surface.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.662
I was wondering what you had been making
over the past few days.

00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:25.664
This was it?

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:30.169
Last time, it smelled of filbert.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:35.007
But this time,
it smells slightly sour and rich.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.884
Impressive indeed.

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:50.939
In short,

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.734
on top of what we sent
to the Ming last time,

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:57.946
you want 50 tribute women
and twice the amount of ginseng.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.823
It is our understanding that you agreed

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:01.658
not to request any more women
as tribute last time.

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.704
Is this truly the Emperor's command?

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.049
He claims he is only upholding
the Emperor's command.

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.592
Then did the Emperor

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:22.012
change his mind without reason?

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.933
As stated last time,
we cannot send any more women.

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.769
As for the ginseng…

00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:35.400
{\an8}I will think about what to do with it
depending on your reciprocal gifts.

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:39.154
High-quality Nanjing Yunjin brocade,

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:43.450
books, the ten most famous Ming teas,

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.869
including black tea,
white tea, yellow tea,

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:49.665
and 100 pieces
of blue and white porcelain.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:51.541
Those are what they offered us last time.

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.378
They are offering
the same reciprocal gifts,

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.839
so why is it that they are demanding
we increase our tribute?

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.008
His Majesty wishes to know

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:04.638
why we are the only ones
who have to increase our tribute.

00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.555
What?

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:11.144
Does the King of Joseon dare question
the orders of the Great Ming Emperor?

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.660
Is this that thing?

00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:29.162
{\an8}The suyu we add to suyu tea?

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.163
{\an8}Suyu tea?

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.331
{\an8}SUYU: OLD NAME FOR BUTTER

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:34.042
Oh, there was a royal tea called suyu tea

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:37.587
that was made by adding butter
to goji berry tea, right?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.550
You're right.
Suyu and butter are the same thing.

00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:46.763
So what are you making with suyu?

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.891
What is this sujebi dough for?

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:53.812
She is not thinking of serving hand-pulled
dough soup with suyu tea, is she?

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.189
The refreshment I'm making is…

00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:01.945
Your Majesty, the refreshments are ready.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.523
He asked what these are.

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:43.945
{\an8}These are macarons.

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.740
{\an8}MACARON: FRENCH DESSERT MADE PRIMARILY
WITH ALMOND FLOUR, SUGAR, AND EGG WHITES

00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:48.575
{\an8}"Macrong"?

00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:50.911
"Macrong"?

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.580
They are commonly eaten as a snack
in Western countries.

00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:56.041
The sweetness puts you in a good mood.

00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:00.712
What are they made with?

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:03.381
The macaron shells are made
with black sesame and almonds…

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:06.843
butter,

00:23:07.427 --> 00:23:09.971
egg whites, and sugar beaten together.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.686
These are Joseon-style macarons
flavored with black sesame, mugwort,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.355
dates, gardenia, and rice.

00:23:22.484 --> 00:23:25.529
What is the rice-cake-looking thing
in the middle?

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:28.031
That's the filling between the shells.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:31.243
I made that by mixing butter, sugar,
and black sesame.

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:34.079
It's a savory and sweet cream filling.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.414
"Creamy"?

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:37.499
Yes.

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:40.752
The crunchy texture,
accompanied by the sweetness,

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.879
will relieve your fatigue.

00:23:47.008 --> 00:23:49.636
I think she explained enough.

00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:51.388
How about you try one?

00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.020
You three taste it first.

00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:49.631
How do you like it?

00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:54.803
This taste…

00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:00.141
He asked about Cook Yeon.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.354
This woman

00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:07.107
is the chief royal cook
I mentioned earlier.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.442
I am Chief Royal Cook Yeon Ji-young.

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:19.953
Your Excellency,
Cook Yeon's macrongs were exquisite.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.381
He wants to take the opportunity
to show you the taste of the Ming as well.

00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:32.757
As you wish.

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:43.727
He suggested

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.647
that Cook Yeon and the Ming cooks compete
to decide the terms of the tribute.

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:49.983
As I heard,

00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.484
it seems his purpose

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:54.321
is to use the competition as an excuse
to take more from us.

00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:56.656
Chinese cuisine is so diverse.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.366
How can I compete against them?

00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:05.332
Say no.

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:10.253
That is a great idea.

00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.213
What are you doing?

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:13.673
Tyrant, have you lost your mind?

00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:16.593
We're not prepared at all,
and they came fully prepared.

00:27:16.676 --> 00:27:17.844
Can't you tell?

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.058
Say no. No!

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.394
However,

00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:29.814
{\an8}you brought three cooks with you.

00:27:29.898 --> 00:27:33.943
{\an8}So how about they compete
with three of my cooks?

00:27:35.528 --> 00:27:37.614
That would be interesting.

00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:40.075
This is so frustrating.

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:42.285
What are you thinking?

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:43.578
What? A team match?

00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:46.247
They can compete in three rounds.

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:50.710
The King of Joseon and I
will be the judges,

00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:54.047
and in the event that the score is tied,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:58.009
we shall have a reputable judge

00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:02.555
taste the food
and come to a final decision.

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:06.184
That is a good idea.

00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:12.107
Let us decide on the themes

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:14.651
at the next banquet.

00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:16.486
Very well.

00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:26.162
You've actually got to be kidding me.

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:29.582
Your Majesty.

00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:32.836
You can't do this
without consulting me first.

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:35.672
You signaled to me with your hand.

00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:37.006
What signal?

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.008
This.

00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.261
I was telling you to say no.

00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:43.179
This is driving me crazy.

00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:45.014
How could you misunderstand that?

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.978
You should handle
political matters politically.

00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:52.021
Cooking is politics.

00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:53.773
Politics is not only conducted

00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:56.317
with swords, spears,
diplomatic events, and documents.

00:28:56.401 --> 00:29:00.280
Resolving political issues
by exchanging food and culture

00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:01.614
is such a peaceful solution.

00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:04.617
You want us to participate in a team match
without any information or preparations?

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:07.287
There's no way. I can't do it.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:09.247
Steam match?

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:11.499
Your Majesty.

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:15.211
Can't you just call off this whole thing?

00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:18.298
Do not tell me
you are not confident you will win.

00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:21.801
It's not about
whether I'm confident or not.

00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:25.972
You can't suddenly tell me to bear
the weight of the country's future.

00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:28.516
I acknowledged you
as the greatest cook in Joseon.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.768
Who can do it if not you?

00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:33.897
Do it for me and the people of Joseon.

00:29:34.522 --> 00:29:36.733
I just can't get through to you.

00:29:36.816 --> 00:29:41.112
Why should I do this for the people?

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:42.989
You are the chief royal cook of Joseon.

00:29:43.072 --> 00:29:45.909
You cannot possibly say
you have nothing to do with the people.

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:48.328
What if we lose?

00:29:48.411 --> 00:29:51.122
You will, of course,
be charged with treason.

00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:53.541
So you want me to risk my life

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:56.711
on yet another competition
that I'm not at all prepared for?

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:59.214
Refusing to compete against the Ming cooks

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.924
would also be considered treason.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:05.762
I will receive numerous letters of appeal,
demanding that you be punished.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:08.515
And eventually…

00:30:09.724 --> 00:30:14.312
You're saying I die if I don't compete,
and I die if I lose.

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:16.231
You understand at last.

00:30:20.693 --> 00:30:24.697
I have no choice but to win
when I don't even have time to prepare.

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:26.950
{\an8}Cook Shanzu of the Tang Dynasty

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:29.744
{\an8}did not become the first female cook
just because she was skilled.

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.120
A true cook

00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:33.957
does not blame the lack of time,
but selects good ingredients

00:30:34.457 --> 00:30:36.125
to create an exquisite dish.

00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:40.004
But you can't expect me
to risk my life at every turn.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.258
I really can't do it this time.

00:30:46.302 --> 00:30:47.720
If you win,

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:51.391
I promise to find Mangunrok for you.

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:55.603
But you promised that already.

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.272
You said you'd find it and let me return.

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.773
I said I would find the book.

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.942
I never promised I would let you leave.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:05.446
Why are you changing your words?
You're scaring me.

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:12.161
Win.

00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:15.373
By all means.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:21.004
Did you say the Ming cooks

00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:23.172
and the Joseon cooks will compete?

00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:27.343
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
What should we do about this matter?

00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:30.680
I thought we had some peace and quiet.

00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:32.891
It would seem that His Majesty

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:35.685
made a big mistake this time.

00:31:35.768 --> 00:31:37.812
Must we stake our nation's fate

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.064
on the cooking skills
of a chief royal cook?

00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:43.318
However great Cook Yeon's skills may be,

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:47.363
there is no guarantee that she will beat
the greatest cooks of the Ming.

00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:51.117
Something must be done

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.077
before we find ourselves in grave trouble.

00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:54.954
What exactly do you mean?

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:56.789
The chief envoy who came this time

00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:59.542
is a eunuch named Yu Kun, is he not?

00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.252
Yes, that is what I heard.

00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.506
His heedless behavior tells me

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.886
he does not know of my relationship
with the Ming imperial family.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.513
I will write you a letter.

00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:15.016
Deliver it to the Ming Emperor.

00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:18.269
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:27.028
This is the refreshment
Cook Yeon served the envoys earlier.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:57.684
She truly has amazing skills.

00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:01.104
Her sunchae was incredible as well.

00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:05.024
{\an8}It is too sweet for my liking.

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:07.318
{\an8}What if she serves something like this

00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:09.529
{\an8}and loses the competition
against the Ming cooks?

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:13.199
We must have someone else participate.

00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:15.451
Who? Cook Maeng?

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.996
Why are you making such a fuss
just because you cannot

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:19.455
get rid of a mere cook?

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.499
Refrain from causing any ruckus,

00:33:21.582 --> 00:33:22.959
at least until we achieve what we want.

00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:24.794
However--

00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:25.878
Do as I say.

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:29.590
Be patient, and in time,

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.010
I will present her to you as a gift.

00:33:32.093 --> 00:33:33.803
Yes, Your Highness.

00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:37.265
The loss in the competition
will humiliate His Majesty,

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:40.435
and Yu Kun will win the right
to harvest Joseon ginseng.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.980
In return, he will provide us
with a reason to replace our king.

00:33:44.647 --> 00:33:47.775
His Majesty will have
brought it upon himself

00:33:48.609 --> 00:33:50.570
by being foolish enough
to agree to the competition.

00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:55.450
Things are working out in our favor.

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.326
The wench's few shallow skills

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.371
will not be enough to beat
the best cooks of the Ming.

00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:05.126
However, she is a lucky wench,
and if His Majesty were to help,

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.336
I cannot be sure of the result.

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:11.299
No matter how much His Majesty tries,

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:15.428
Cook Yeon will not be able to win.

00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:18.056
Hearing you say that

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.267
makes me look forward
to the competition even more.

00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:28.191
This is from Grand Prince Jesan.

00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:35.239
Is there something
you wish to say to me in private?

00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:37.116
His Majesty

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.786
is not of sound mind.

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:41.662
He often has fits

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.123
and even sees things that are not there.

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.333
Oh dear.

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.668
Is this really true?

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.420
Whenever he has a fit,

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.798
he causes strange incidents
that negatively impact the court,

00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:54.008
so Joseon must resolve this issue
as soon as possible.

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:58.096
Please relay this

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:01.599
to the Emperor.

00:35:01.682 --> 00:35:04.060
Are you saying you wish

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.521
to change your ruler?

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:12.819
Then what do I stand to gain from this?

00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:17.073
I will ensure
that you win the cooking competition,

00:35:17.156 --> 00:35:20.118
so set the stakes high.

00:35:20.201 --> 00:35:23.621
Instead of 50, demand 100 tribute women.

00:35:23.704 --> 00:35:26.874
Instead of demanding
double the amount of ginseng,

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:31.712
demand the right
to harvest all the ginseng in Joseon.

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:35.925
The thought alone pleases me greatly.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.555
However,

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:44.225
it is a given that the greatest cooks
of the Ming will win the competition.

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:47.436
How do you plan to help with that?

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.858
My lord, the chief royal cook of Joseon
is incredibly skilled.

00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:57.321
You tasted her food yourself,
so you must know.

00:35:58.406 --> 00:35:59.991
What if I refuse?

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:06.747
This is a record we kept

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:12.545
of all the gifts you received
and the dates they were received.

00:36:13.629 --> 00:36:17.216
Lord Sung! Are you threatening me,
the Emperor's envoy?

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.343
I would not dare to.

00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:23.347
I will leave this here.

00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:32.523
Considering our long-standing ties,

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:35.651
I trust that you will help us.

00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:41.449
Our long-standing ties, you say?

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:05.056
He is one sneaky old man.

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.934
Seeing how the officials who serve
one king are divided in their loyalties,

00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:11.520
it seems that this nation
is nearing its end as well.

00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:14.232
What do you mean by that?

00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:16.067
It is none of your concern.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:21.322
It seems that Joseon's chief royal cook
is greatly skilled.

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.449
Are you referring
to the refreshment, my lord?

00:37:24.116 --> 00:37:26.118
That was just a petty trick.

00:37:26.202 --> 00:37:27.912
That does not mean she can truly--

00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:29.455
Every competition must be taken seriously.

00:37:30.373 --> 00:37:32.708
The pride of our great nation is at stake.

00:37:34.961 --> 00:37:38.714
Petty trick or not,

00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:41.008
I have to say I am quite curious

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:45.805
as to how skilled the cooks of Joseon are.

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:48.140
How about I test them?

00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:50.643
- Ya Feixiu!
- No, Bailong.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.603
Yes, my lord.

00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:54.855
We must take this competition
as an opportunity

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:58.109
to humiliate and discourage
the Joseon king.

00:37:58.734 --> 00:38:01.070
Will you have a go?

00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:03.197
Leave it to me, my lord.

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:18.713
Damn, that was close.

00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:22.717
- After him!
- Yes!

00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:30.516
{\an8}GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:33.436
{\an8}Goodness me. They sensed my presence?

00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:35.646
How chilling.

00:38:38.774 --> 00:38:40.318
Are they that well-trained?

00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:43.571
Yes, Your Majesty.
They are no ordinary cooks.

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:46.866
So…

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:50.786
the Right State Councilor was there?

00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:59.003
Did the talk with the envoy go well?

00:38:59.086 --> 00:39:01.464
Yes, Your Highness. Do not worry.

00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.758
All you did was exchange a few words.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.468
Can he be trusted?

00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:09.638
Yu Kun is cunning beyond belief.

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:11.891
This is the second volume of the ledger.

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:14.810
I gave him the first volume.

00:39:15.436 --> 00:39:16.812
Well done.

00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:20.399
Are you sure it is a good idea
to hand over the rights

00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:22.193
to harvest all of Joseon's ginseng?

00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:23.319
Right now,

00:39:24.236 --> 00:39:25.946
we must protect our nation,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.157
even if it means making a sacrifice.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.658
The royal family must stand strong

00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.620
for the nation to stand strong.

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:33.704
That is right.

00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.582
This is a small sacrifice we must make

00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:38.876
to protect our nation.

00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:40.753
Let us proceed without hesitation.

00:39:40.836 --> 00:39:42.380
Since we have made the call,

00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.715
we must move ahead without looking back.

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:45.925
We must find a way

00:39:46.592 --> 00:39:50.221
to guarantee the Ming cooks' victory
in the competition.

00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:54.308
I hope you will help
to the best of your ability.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.352
This competition

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:59.772
must be the starting point
for a new Joseon Dynasty.

00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:02.775
At all costs.

00:40:02.858 --> 00:40:06.320
Soon, this draft of the historical record
will serve its purpose.

00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.530
Indeed.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.492
Our time is coming.

00:40:14.537 --> 00:40:17.998
What did you do
with the arsenic I gave you?

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:20.709
Ever since
His Majesty's physical examination,

00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:24.380
the royal kitchen has been too busy,
so I did not have the chance to use it.

00:40:24.463 --> 00:40:25.756
Of course.

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.135
There is always an excuse.

00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:33.222
Soon, you will compete
against the Ming cooks.

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.809
A cooking competition, Your Grace?

00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:40.479
Yes, and you will participate.

00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:42.273
I will see to it that you do.

00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:45.943
Yes, Your Grace. I will give my all
to uphold the honor of the royal kitchen.

00:40:46.026 --> 00:40:48.195
No, that is not it.

00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:51.198
Joseon must lose this competition.

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:53.492
Pardon?

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.254
Don't rub your eyes after touching these.

00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:08.007
I am plucking off the tops
and taking out the seeds

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.634
because you say
you need this for the competition, but…

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.722
You should have told me sooner!

00:41:14.805 --> 00:41:17.224
What do you need these for anyway?

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.059
We'll dry them,

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:22.354
crush them into powder, and make a paste.

00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:25.357
They say these are so spicy
that some even died eating them.

00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:27.443
What paste can you make with them?

00:41:27.526 --> 00:41:30.946
- Do they become edible when dried?
- Goodness.

00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:36.619
They're not poisonous.
You can eat them as they are.

00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:39.079
Did you see that?

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:42.541
She said this is a secret weapon
for the competition.

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:45.336
- Put your fingers to work now.
- That's right. Well said.

00:41:46.629 --> 00:41:48.214
- Man-su.
- How is it?

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.676
It must be spicy.

00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:58.849
Greetings.

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.143
- Eunuch Yoon.
- Greetings, Eunuch Yoon.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.648
Cook Yeon, His Majesty wishes to see you.

00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:07.107
What about the travel plaque I asked for?

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.319
You will hear about that
when you go see him.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.446
Okay.

00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:17.618
Your Majesty.

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:24.833
So I heard

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.294
you need a travel plaque.

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.462
Yes.

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:30.589
I have to go to the mill myself
and explain what I need

00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:33.175
for the new seasoning
we'll be using in the competition.

00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:34.093
The mill?

00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:36.595
Then are you going to Unjongga?

00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:38.472
Yes.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.726
If that is the case, I must go with you.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.187
What? You're going to join me?

00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:50.067
Is it okay for you
to just leave the palace on a whim?

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.485
On a whim, you say?

00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:53.654
You said you need the seasoning
for the competition.

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:55.364
What could be more important than that?

00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:57.700
That's true, but still…

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.537
Hurry up and prepare yourself.

00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:03.622
I don't need to prepare anything.

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:05.040
I'll just wait outside.

00:43:05.124 --> 00:43:07.960
Are you thinking
of going around the market

00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:09.920
in your chief royal cook's attire?

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:11.088
Well…

00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:13.507
You must change into your disguise attire.

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.758
My disguise attire?

00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:17.636
The only other clothes I have

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.264
are Gil-geum's clothes
that she let me wear.

00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:22.308
How pathetic.

00:43:24.393 --> 00:43:25.644
Follow me.

00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:27.563
Chang-seon.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:38.258
Is all this really necessary
when I'm just dropping by the mill?

00:44:39.426 --> 00:44:40.469
{\an8}Meet me in front of Gyemumun.

00:44:40.552 --> 00:44:42.054
{\an8}GYEMUMUN: SMALL GATE
NEXT TO BONGDEOKGUNG'S NORTH GATE

00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:44.056
{\an8}What? Where?

00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:48.268
But…

00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:02.241
Let us go.

00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:10.040
We sell hair ribbons too.

00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:12.167
We have straw hats.

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:29.309
Oh my, the colors are so pretty.

00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:34.606
Goodness, come this way and have a look.

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.610
Pretty, are they not?

00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:43.115
This looks similar

00:45:43.198 --> 00:45:45.617
to the one hanging from Mangunrok.

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:47.578
It costs ten nip.

00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.414
Oh, that's fine. I don't need it.

00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:53.041
- Come along.
- Take a look.

00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:01.300
Oh, this is it.

00:46:01.383 --> 00:46:02.217
I found the place.

00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:04.052
I'll take that.

00:46:04.136 --> 00:46:05.345
Thank you.

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:08.724
I need to go somewhere for a bit.

00:46:09.308 --> 00:46:11.852
Okay, then we can meet back here later.

00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:14.062
Wait.

00:46:16.982 --> 00:46:18.108
Oh, come on.

00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:21.195
I have money too.

00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:25.991
Take it.

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:27.868
I really don't need it.

00:46:29.244 --> 00:46:30.454
See you later.

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:35.876
I have never ground
anything like this before.

00:46:38.712 --> 00:46:40.172
What is this?

00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:41.882
They're gochu, chili peppers.

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:44.384
They're spicy, so you might
have a hard time with them.

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.220
Regardless, I'll be counting on you.

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:48.096
Sure. That will be five nip.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.098
Five nip?

00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:53.060
I heard it would cost just two.

00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:56.980
I would've been in big trouble
if he hadn't given me this.

00:46:58.023 --> 00:47:00.234
Please cut down on the cost
when I become a regular.

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.610
Thank you.

00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:10.202
Give me that.

00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:14.206
We will take them all.

00:47:33.475 --> 00:47:36.103
He said he'd be gone for a bit.
Why isn't he back yet?

00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:39.314
Where did he go?

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.735
I want to look around some more.

00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:48.073
I'll be quick.

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:59.585
Is the chief royal cook still at the mill?

00:47:59.668 --> 00:48:01.295
I will go inside and check, Your Majesty.

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:03.505
You do that.

00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:25.652
Goodness, it is a sun-shower.
What do we do with all these?

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.738
What is with the sudden shower?

00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:30.240
What a lovely day. My goodness.

00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:35.120
Why are you taking
our precious ingredient?

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.336
That sure is potent.

00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:45.297
What is this scent?

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:54.640
Who are you?

00:48:54.723 --> 00:48:57.267
Strangers are not allowed to come in here.

00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:59.728
This is Ya Feixiu, one of the Ming cooks.

00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:01.605
What? The Ming?

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:06.526
Cook Maeng! Cook Eom!

00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:10.405
It is raining hard.

00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:12.949
- Hwang, hold onto this for me.
- Okay.

00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:15.035
- Cook Min.
- Yes?

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.371
You have really improved
at chopping green onions.

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:19.039
Thank you, Bong-sik.

00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:25.420
The Ming cook. She bit into a gochu--

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:27.964
Take a breath first and speak slowly.

00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:29.174
Listen.

00:49:29.257 --> 00:49:32.636
The Ming cook
is here at the royal kitchen.

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:54.074
I am Cook Eom of the royal kitchen.

00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:02.416
What did she say?

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:04.960
She said your knife skills are decent.

00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:07.671
She said his knife skills are dreadful.

00:50:07.754 --> 00:50:09.131
Did you think I would not understand?

00:50:09.756 --> 00:50:10.632
What?

00:50:14.928 --> 00:50:18.974
How dare you act so insolently
in Joseon's royal kitchen?

00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:20.892
What a mess.

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.144
Hey, you!

00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:25.480
Cook Eom, I have been chopping
in the royal kitchen for over ten years!

00:50:25.564 --> 00:50:26.523
I cannot take this.

00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:28.442
Move. Neither can I.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:31.528
Do you want to have a green onion
chopping competition or something?

00:50:32.654 --> 00:50:34.740
Settle down, everyone.

00:50:34.823 --> 00:50:37.576
She is with the envoy's entourage.

00:50:37.659 --> 00:50:39.202
How about a green onion
chopping competition?

00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:41.496
A chopping contest?

00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:44.833
With such pitiful knife skills?

00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:47.753
"Pitiful knife skills"?
Watch what you say!

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:52.174
Even a dog gets some respect in its home.
Who do you think you--

00:50:52.257 --> 00:50:53.550
This is not your fight.

00:50:53.633 --> 00:50:54.801
You are so noisy.

00:50:56.136 --> 00:51:00.015
They say an empty cart
rattles the loudest.

00:51:03.268 --> 00:51:04.394
Where is the chief royal cook?

00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.604
The chief royal cook?

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.856
I will take you on!

00:51:07.939 --> 00:51:09.775
Stop insulting my seniors,

00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:11.777
and let us settle this
with a chopping competition!

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.613
How ridiculous.

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:16.740
Are you all…

00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:25.081
sure about this?

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.879
Cook Min.

00:51:30.962 --> 00:51:33.173
Are you sure about this?

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.176
Cook Maeng can chop just as well,

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:39.262
so if it is too much pressure,
leave it to him.

00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.973
No. She looks like
the youngest of the three.

00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:45.185
It would look better for us
if Cook Min were to settle things.

00:51:48.313 --> 00:51:50.273
Cook Min, speed is important,

00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.442
but it is even more important
to cut uniform pieces.

00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:54.277
I will remember that.

00:51:54.361 --> 00:51:56.696
Cook Min, I believe in you.

00:52:06.998 --> 00:52:08.917
Where in the world
did the chief royal cook go

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.418
when she does not even know
her way around?

00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:11.837
I apologize, Your Majesty.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.381
I have checked the back alleys,
so I will go check the bigger streets.

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.340
You do that.

00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:19.052
I will wait here in case she returns.

00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:20.804
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:57.966
You're back.

00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:00.969
Where did you go?

00:53:01.052 --> 00:53:03.179
I was waiting for you,
then went to get some flowers.

00:53:03.263 --> 00:53:05.807
I see you are getting around just fine
despite the rain.

00:53:06.641 --> 00:53:08.018
What is that?

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.061
They're irises.

00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:12.731
It's a flower that helps soothe the mind.

00:53:13.398 --> 00:53:14.399
Eyeless?

00:53:21.656 --> 00:53:22.908
These are butkkot.

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:24.993
"Butkkot"?

00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:43.970
My flowers.

00:53:45.138 --> 00:53:47.140
Oh no, what a shame.

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:50.393
I will get you prettier flowers.

00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:53.271
We shall head back now.

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:55.607
But…

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:02.530
Why are you not coming?

00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:04.449
Just a second.

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:11.581
Do not pick up what fell on the ground.

00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:14.501
I picked these to give to you.

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.461
They have medicinal properties

00:54:16.544 --> 00:54:19.047
and soothe the mind,
so they're good to keep in the room.

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.842
It is surprising
that I even crossed your mind

00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.844
when the competition is nearing.

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.472
We could've planted it in Jangwonseo,
Office of Royal Horticulture.

00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.380
Your…

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.394
Your Majesty.

00:55:15.103 --> 00:55:16.646
- Your face.
- What?

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.943
Right here.

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.365
What did you just do?

00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:31.536
There was something on your face.

00:55:34.539 --> 00:55:36.583
There is something on yours as well.

00:55:40.545 --> 00:55:42.797
Darn it. Stop it.

00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:44.924
- What? Come here.
- Stay away.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.718
- Stop it.
- Come here.

00:55:48.386 --> 00:55:49.679
Come back here.

00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:53.892
Your face is a mess.

00:55:54.893 --> 00:55:56.519
It has become even more unattractive.

00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:59.689
Oh, I sincerely apologize, Your Majesty.

00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:01.983
Your face is just as dirty.

00:56:02.567 --> 00:56:03.777
What?

00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:08.656
You gave me a gift today,

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:12.202
so I shall make a special exception
and disregard your insolence.

00:56:12.285 --> 00:56:14.746
I'm so grateful that you like the gift.

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:20.126
Is it okay for you to leave the palace
for this long?

00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:24.798
What could be more important
than preparing the ingredients

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.257
for the cooking competition?

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.635
That's true.

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:30.887
Tell me.

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:35.350
Can you actually win the competition
with the gocho?

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.019
I can't say for sure,

00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:40.438
but I think we'll need something striking.

00:56:40.939 --> 00:56:42.690
The gochugaru and gochujang

00:56:42.774 --> 00:56:45.652
are secret seasonings that will be
very important in the competition.

00:56:46.611 --> 00:56:49.405
You know what they taste like.

00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:51.241
You had the bibimbap
at the thatched house.

00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:00.792
Oh, the taste
that brought tears to my eyes.

00:57:01.793 --> 00:57:02.961
Yes.

00:57:03.628 --> 00:57:06.297
I'll get back to the royal kitchen.

00:57:07.006 --> 00:57:09.175
Give me your hand.

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:11.594
What? My hand?

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:20.979
This is the ornament from earlier.

00:57:21.062 --> 00:57:23.148
Well, you seemed to want it.

00:57:23.815 --> 00:57:27.277
Did he notice me fiddling with it earlier?

00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:31.739
I shall take my leave.

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:49.632
Oh, right.

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:56.389
I mean, would it be so hard for you
to bring these inside?

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.575
Butkkot.

00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.663
Butkkot…

00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:47.482
How will I face him
if I lose after all this?

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.957
Are you all right?

00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:08.378
The Ming chef?

00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:11.130
Joseon's chief royal cook.

00:59:12.298 --> 00:59:13.883
What were you doing here?

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:17.011
You got lucky today.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.351
Your fellow cooks
seem to be waiting eagerly for you.

00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:30.650
What the…

00:59:32.026 --> 00:59:34.070
What on earth happened here?

00:59:34.153 --> 00:59:35.780
Miss!

00:59:35.863 --> 00:59:37.407
Miss.

00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:41.828
So what happened was…

00:59:42.453 --> 00:59:45.123
It's okay, Gil-geum.
Slow down and tell me what happened.

00:59:45.206 --> 00:59:47.500
Okay. That nasty Ya Feixiu or whatever

00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:50.378
is incredibly skillful.

00:59:50.878 --> 00:59:54.382
She had a green onion
chopping competition with Cook Min, and…

00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.014
She was like a Shaolin warrior.

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.933
She showed unwavering focus
and extraordinary knife skills.

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:07.478
That was not all.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.149
I am actually afraid of knives, you see.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.660
I felt so rushed

01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:25.913
and ended up chopping parts
we do not even eat.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:30.835
But I did not expect Cook Maeng to lose.

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:56.819
This is the first time
I have been outpaced in knife work.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:01:00.114
So all of you lost?

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.909
We have absolutely no excuses.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.119
What do we do, miss?

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.711
This is a declaration of war, isn't it?

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.798
How dare she come into our kitchen
without the slightest bit of courtesy?

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:18.675
Damn it.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.471
Who cares how much
and how fast you can chop

01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:25.473
when you don't even have
basic human decency?

01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:28.142
I can tell what she's like just by looking
at the way she's chopped this.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:29.477
It's not cool at all.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.312
She's just a show-off.

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:33.731
Darn her.

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:37.193
Are you all just going to give up?

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:39.404
They made a mess of the royal kitchen.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:42.907
We must make them pay
for looking down on Joseon cooks!

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:44.826
Right?

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:47.954
Right?

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.205
Yes.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.708
We can take them on!

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.460
I will not lose to them!

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.379
If we compete again,

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:59.132
I will show her
what the true balance of chopping is.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.468
I will give it another try.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.595
Just tell me what you need.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.806
I will do whatever I can to help.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.975
We will also help out.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.977
- Us too.
- We will help too.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.855
- We will too.
- I will do what I can!

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.274
All right, good. This is great!

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:18.609
We can do this. We'll go nail it!

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.445
- Nail what?
- What nail?

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:22.447
- What?
- What was that?

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:27.994
Rise, royal kitchen!

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.329
- Rise, royal kitchen!
- Rise, royal kitchen!

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:31.664
Let's fight, royal kitchen!

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.458
- Let's fight, royal kitchen!
- Let's fight, royal kitchen!

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.209
Let's win, royal kitchen!

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:38.463
- Let's win, royal kitchen!
- Let's win, royal kitchen!

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:46.053
So how were the Joseon cooks?

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.639
I competed with them
in a green onion chopping competition,

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:51.058
and their basic knife skills
were pathetic.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:53.394
What about the chief royal cook?

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:56.272
She was not there.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.275
You wasted time playing with the minions.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.069
Not entirely.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:09.702
I found out they have
a special seasoning ingredient.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.830
What is this?

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:19.086
It smells like mala, but it is different.

01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:29.305
I guess we will find out
when the competition begins.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.770
I am very curious to see

01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:40.650
what is making the Joseon king
so confident.

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:50.618
{\an8}However great her skills may be,

01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:53.120
how can he put the nation's fate
on the line over a competition?

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:56.249
The Ming envoy
brought three cooks of his own,

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.084
so it seems he had planned it all along.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:02.380
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
is devising a plan,

01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:04.215
so do not worry too much.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:08.553
Son, if our cooks lose this competition,

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.847
it will greatly damage
His Majesty's reputation.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.475
Have you any clever device?

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:16.143
Father.

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:18.187
Do not worry too much.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.358
They can do what they want,
but they are in the land of Joseon.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:27.196
I will not allow them to get their way.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.115
I cannot accept that.

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:44.964
SWEET

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.181
MEAT

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:55.766
FISH

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.155
He says you can pick first, Your Majesty.

01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:10.489
No.

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:13.409
You should pick first.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.917
He is suggesting picking at the same time.

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:22.835
Shall we do that?

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.854
Mu, meaning "nonexistent,"
and yuk, meaning "meat."

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.815
Mu, meaning "nonexistent,"
and yuk, meaning "meat"!

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:48.569
For the first round,

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:52.156
they will have to make a meat dish
that has never been seen before.

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:56.827
Correct. A meat dish
the world has never seen.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.923
You pick the next one, Chief Royal Cook.

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:11.384
Pardon?

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:12.969
Me?

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:14.595
Yes.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:19.934
Bailong.

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:23.229
Yes, my lord.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.214
Ji, meaning "know,"
and yeok, meaning "change."

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.717
Ji, meaning "know,"
and yeok, meaning "change"!

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:57.179
"Know" and "change"…

01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:04.186
He suggests picking again,
as the combination makes no sense.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.522
"Know" and "change"…

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:15.448
Diplomacy is about learning
and understanding each other's cultures.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:17.283
With that being said,

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.494
how about we cook each other's fare?

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.331
Are you suggesting
that for the second round,

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:27.543
the Ming cooks are to make a Joseon dish,

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:30.046
and the Joseon cooks
are to make a Ming dish?

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.298
That is exactly it.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.302
What an interesting idea.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.638
Why is he so relaxed?

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.683
Is he that confident
they can cook Joseon dishes?

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:45.728
It is time to pick the third theme.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.738
Will you do the honors, Uncle?

01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.200
Your Highness.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.202
- Your Highness.
- What?

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.329
- What?
- You are to pick one.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.246
Pick one?

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:06.540
Oh, of course.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:08.751
Me?

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:11.712
Yes. You are the Superintendent
of Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals,

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.756
so you shall pick one.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:17.176
Very well then.

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:20.096
I like the feeling of suspense.

01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:22.515
Kong Wenli.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.642
Yes, my lord.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:29.647
Let me see.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:44.411
Tang, meaning "soup,"
and sam, meaning "ginseng."

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:47.456
Tang, meaning "soup,"
and sam, meaning "ginseng"!

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:54.130
Is not their fare known for soups?

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.799
It will be a tough round.

01:08:56.882 --> 01:08:58.050
It seems so.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.012
"Ginseng" and "soup"…

01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.432
I see we have soup.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.103
Then in the final round,

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.772
they will make a soup dish
containing ginseng.

01:09:22.616 --> 01:09:26.495
He is suggesting raising the stakes
now that the themes have been decided.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:31.458
He wishes to raise the stakes now?

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.005
How so?

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.974
He would like 100 tribute women
on top of what was agreed,

01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:50.060
as well as the right
to harvest Joseon ginseng.

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:53.147
- What did he say?
- What nonsense is that?

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:55.149
- What utter nonsense.
- Goodness.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.200
In that case,

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.161
we shall also add to our conditions.

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:11.749
If Joseon wins,

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:15.044
the Ming is to receive
only half the tribute

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:17.254
and allow Joseon to purchase

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.257
as much sugarcane and flour as we wish
before they are harvested.

01:10:24.094 --> 01:10:28.641
As much flour as they wish?

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.979
How is this any different
from asking our great nation

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.439
to pay tribute to Joseon instead?

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.486
What is the matter?
Are you not confident you will win?

01:10:42.863 --> 01:10:45.824
He says this is a matter that requires
the opinion of the Emperor and the court,

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.578
and that he cannot make the decision
on his own.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.333
Then we shall adhere to
what we previously agreed on.

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:06.720
He says if the Ming loses,
he will strongly petition the Emperor

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.138
to accept the conditions.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:11.767
Very well.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:15.562
Chief Royal Secretary,
record all that was discussed today.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:18.399
The cooks representing each nation
will compete in a total of three rounds,

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.192
{\an8}and the competition will last one sijin.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.110
{\an8}ONE SIJIN: APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS

01:11:21.193 --> 01:11:23.862
{\an8}The time to select the dishes
and prepare the ingredients

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:24.947
will be three days.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:31.662
Which might not be enough time,

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:33.122
so it will be five days.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.126
Very well.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:40.129
Five days shall it be.

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:41.297
In conclusion, the competition

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.841
{\an8}will be held in five days at misi,
thirteenth to fifteenth hour,

01:11:43.924 --> 01:11:45.301
{\an8}at Huijeongdang.

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:47.553
The cooks from both nations

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.221
shall step forward
to pay their respects to each other.

01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:08.449
You left your knife
in the royal kitchen yesterday.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:15.873
I brought it back to Taepyeonggwan,
Official Reception Hall, safe and sound.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.468
How rude.

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:29.595
Is this

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.680
the Joseon way?

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:38.645
How dare they challenge me outright?

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.651
They completely ruined the blade.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.462
Brace yourselves, envoys.

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:06.465
I'll give you a blazing hot taste.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.810
PRESSURE COOKER, PACKING,
COMPRESS, CAST-IRON POT

01:13:38.872 --> 01:13:41.792
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:42.793
{\an8}This pressure cooker.

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:46.422
{\an8}There is one man in Joseon
who can make this.

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:48.632
{\an8}He is the descendant of the
grand military protector Jang Yeong-sil.

01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:50.634
{\an8}I should accompany you.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.220
{\an8}- My legs are killing me.
- What a pain.

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.638
{\an8}Your Majesty, please!

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.056
{\an8}It's a cannon.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.267
{\an8}- Get out of here!
- Is he out of his mind?

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.894
{\an8}His Majesty has left the palace again?

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:05.149
{\an8}A lot of dangerous things
happen outside the palace.

01:14:05.232 --> 01:14:06.108
{\an8}The target

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.610
{\an8}is the chief royal cook.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.529
{\an8}Cook Yeon!

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:17.828
