00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.560
Destined by the sky,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.760
Long life and prosperity.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.280
I

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:31.120
is your sky.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.280
May the Emperor live long!

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.359
May the Emperor live long!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.239
May the Emperor live long!

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.359
May the Emperor live long!

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.640
Emperor.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.159
Emperor.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.840
This old servant dared to risk
his life to give advice.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.200
Hey.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.959
Today is happy.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.200
Will not die.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.000
Tuan Gong.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.400
Please take a seat of honor.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.120
Emperor, I dare
to give you some advice.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.639
Worldly pleasures such as music,
women, and hunting were common pastimes.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.599
It is not a way to build yourself
and cultivate virtue.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.080
I beg the Emperor
to stay away from this false luxury

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.879
and focus
on national affairs

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.319
in order to calm the entire country.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.439
Why haven't you stepped back yet?

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.599
Mr. Gong has spoken.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.360
All back down.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.840
Good.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.360
Get up quickly.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.680
Emperor.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.800
You should get closer
to the ministers of the Emperor Xiaozhao Era,

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.240
and made descendants of
the late Emperor's ministers his confidants.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.400
If you can't bear to leave
your old friends from Changyi

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.080
and trust cunning people,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.439
you will definitely be hit by disaster.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.360
May the Emperor turn
disaster into blessing.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.520
Banish the cunning criminals
from among the old officials of Changyi

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.919
out of government.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.479
Even though I, Gong Sui,
am not a criminal,

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.759
also an old official from Changyi.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.960
I'm ready to be the first to go.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.919
for example.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.360
Emperor.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.000
Tuan Gong.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.439
What are you...

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.439
Tuan Gong.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.680
I did all this to fulfill
your secret heavenly request.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.479
Every day as soon as dawn breaks,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.840
I have to call the servants
to the hall to have fun.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.240
In the afternoon we have to drink alcohol
and play music.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800
As evening approached, we still had to check
the tribute delivered by the envoy.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.080
Look.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.800
Mr. Gong was furious.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.680
Mr. Gong will surely
understand my good intentions.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.839
Hopefully so.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.839
Being a tyrannical emperor is
really not easy.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.319
It's really heartbreaking.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.120
Location.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.480
I see you're actually enjoying it.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360
If possible,

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.199
I want to carry a sword
and travel all over the world.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.959
Although his life
was a little simpler, his heart was free.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.319
It doesn't have to be like this now.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.240
Acting all the time.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.759
Pretend.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.319
To be this emperor

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:50.920
It has really bothered you.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.800
Already arrived here.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.120
Drink a cup of wine before leaving.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.720
Hey, wait.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.560
My arrival here

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.480
is to ask something from you.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.680
Why did Mr. Wang call us here?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.720
I just want you gentlemen to
agree on one thing.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.920
What's that?

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.079
Huo Guang controls the government,

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.120
act arbitrarily.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.120
I beg you all

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.959
together with me
to get rid of Huo Guang.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240
What?

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.920
I think you're crazy.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.000
Bamboo slabs here

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.879
record all the crimes

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.839
that you have ever done.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.879
Whose name will appear on it,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.079
I think you know it yourself in your heart.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.639
Just with a pile of
broken bamboo slabs

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.680
You think you can make us
fight Mr. Huo?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.600
Who are you fooling?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.199
Aren't you Mr. Sun Wu?

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.360
Correct.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.319
You are seizing land.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.000
Once you earn a profit of 400 thousand coins.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.399
There is a subordinate of yours who made a mistake,

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.040
You immediately asked
him for 500 gold pieces.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.480
Your position is not high.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.759
but you have big guts.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.199
You have no evidence at all.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.959
Just slander!

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.319
I even know where
you hid the gold.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.879
How about
I take you there now,

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.639
so that you get caught red-handed
with the evidence?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.720
Who else?

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.360
who wants to know his own shame?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.279
Let me tell you guys.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.199
I know the things
you have done.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.600
What Huo Guang asked you to do,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.879
I know it too.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:13.720
Prime Minister Yang,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.879
Do you think that avoiding problems
can save yourself?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.040
Let me tell you.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.959
When Huo Guang wants to overthrow the emperor,
you will be the first one he will come to.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.680
Tian Yannian will ask you,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.680
What do you think if Huo Guang
wants to appoint another wise ruler?

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.319
Besides, your wife
will definitely advise you.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.040
to listen to
all of Huo Guang's arrangements,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.680
making you Huo Guang's ally.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:34.879
I do everything for the country.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.439
As for all of you,

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.399
Huo Guang

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.279
will approach you one by one.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.079
Tian Yannian will stick
a sharp sword into the floor

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:43.920
and said to you,

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.759
The country is the main one.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.279
You all hold high positions,

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.920
the goal is for this country to be eternal.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.959
Finally, he will threaten you
by saying

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.199
who disagrees
or who agrees last

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.959
Don't blame his
unforgiving sword.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.879
True or false?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.920
(Advisor, Xiahou Sheng)
Then what should we do?

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.120
You don't need to do anything.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:08.439
So why did we come here?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.360
We already have the perfect plan.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.600
As long as you all
don't side with Huo Guang,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.879
I won't make things difficult for you.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:18.759
The bamboo slabs that are here

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.800
I will deliver it myself to your residence.

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:22.600
This problem

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:24.560
just pretend it never happened.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:25.639
Later on,

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.360
you all try your best

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.800
to accompany the new emperor.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.600
Tuan Xiahou.

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:37.759
Tuan Xiahou.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:40.120
Please wait a moment.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:42.120
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.079
Yes.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.519
Hmm.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.000
Mr. Huo has come.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.159
The emperor called.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.159
Even though I have been lying sick for a long time,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.759
still have to come to the palace
to appear.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.519
I heard that there are many rare animals in this Hunting Ground .

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:56.559
Since childhood, I have longed
to race horses.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.559
and feel the thrill
of chasing wild animals.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.320
However, since ascending the throne,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.200
Every day I am confined
within these square walls.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:04.200
It's really boring.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:06.320
Tomorrow I want to go
hunting out of town.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:11.440
The Emperor is the son of Heaven.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.559
You can go as you please.

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.519
I don't interfere in big matters anymore,

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.039
especially trivial things like this.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.919
If I'm out of town,

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:22.919
Don't you need Mr. Huo's approval?

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:34.399
Oh.

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.600
I've been presumptuous.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.000
The bow is full but not released,

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.679
could lose momentum.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.039
This is the lesson I learned.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:08.360
The Emperor is the son of Heaven.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.559
Tomorrow while hunting,

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.759
can certainly show authority.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.200
In that case,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.320
Mr. Huo agrees?

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:29.360
I will send my son, Huo Yu,
to accompany you.

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:30.960
He is an expert in horse riding and archery,

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:33.960
can definitely guarantee the safety of the Emperor.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.639
Huo Yu?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.480
No problem.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.679
Tomorrow we take him to the dense forest

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:46.960
and just get rid of it.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.320
The most important,

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.480
Wucheng Village soldiers
must wait here tomorrow.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.360
(Hunting Field)

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.320
Don't delay.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.056
(Kediaman Huo)

00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:58.720
Dad,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.080
Don't hesitate anymore.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.279
This emperor is stupid and tyrannical.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.679
Even the celebration letter has been changed.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.039
Openly against Dad.

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:08.480
Better act now.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.679
than regretting it later.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.159
Sir, from the very beginning you could have
supported the new emperor's ascension to the throne,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.159
why until now

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.799
did not report to Empress Dowager Shangguan

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:19.080
to find a new ruler
and adopt him?

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.480
Moreover, the Emperor had not yet prayed
at the ancestral shrine.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.440
This is a very serious problem.

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:29.279
Since ancient times,

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.639
in all dynasties,

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.159
The ruler is always a role model for his subordinates.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.320
A minister's job is only to help.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.120
Is there a reason for the minister
to impeach the emperor?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.159
Isn't this like
reversing the fate of the heavens?

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.960
If I may say,
there is already a precedent.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.559
Even got praise
and good name from the next generation.

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:56.279
Is there really such an example?

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.039
As a ruler,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.399
must have talented people.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600
During the Shang Dynasty,

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:01.639
King Tai Jia of Shang
acted arbitrarily.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.240
Prime Minister Yi Yin
decided to isolate him.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.080
The country was saved.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.080
Descendants praise his loyalty
and wisdom.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.080
His dedication to the country

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.120
how could it be considered rebellious?

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.159
If you dare to make a decision,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.200
names will be recorded in history.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.480
You will definitely be the Yi Yin of
the Han Dynasty.

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:22.600
Commander in Chief.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.399
Emperor Wu of Han trusted the Lord

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:26.840
to protect the Han Dynasty.

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:29.799
If the Emperor continues to act recklessly,

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:33.159
we also betrayed the
ancestral trust of the Han Dynasty.

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:35.279
We can no longer doubt.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:36.840
You can't doubt anymore.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.559
Dad, we can't doubt.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.159
(Huo Guang suddenly came to his senses.)

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.159
(Because there are examples from past dynasties,)

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:47.519
(He doesn't have to hesitate anymore.)

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:48.919
(Yi Yin)

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.799
(was a famous minister of the Shang Dynasty.)

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.919
(Emperor Tai Jia did not practice
benevolent governance in the past,)

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:54.679
(tyrant and corrupt.)

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.600
(Yi Yin impeached him,)

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.480
(then took over power.)

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:02.919
The late Emperor,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.120
Huo Guang is not talented.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.519
Can't choose people

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:11.240
and has betrayed your trust.

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:13.879
For the Han Dynasty,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.840
now there is only one way

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:19.159
correcting errors.

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:22.879
Restoring the correct order.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.960
The Generals,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.039
Tomorrow the Emperor will hunt
with the Changyi officials.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.519
Let's act like this.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.159
Midnight, three o'clock,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.440
all safe.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.440
Midnight.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.720
All is safe.

00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:47.072
(Yang's Residence)

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:55.639
Prime Minister,

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:57.200
why Mr. Tian

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200
coming tonight?

00:13:58.679 --> 00:14:00.120
What is the need?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.519
Prime Minister,

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.799
Do you know the latest issues at the palace?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.279
I

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:07.639
was sick and lying down.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:08.879
Government affairs

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:11.360
I don't know much.

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:13.000
The new emperor has just ascended the throne,

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.120
his actions are chaotic,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.200
immoral and depraved life.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:17.559
Do you know?

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:20.120
I've heard about it.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.480
An emperor

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.360
must be disciplined.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.960
When the previous Emperor died,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.200
Great General Huo

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:31.039
urge the appointment of a new emperor.

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.720
Now the new ruler is incompetent.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.600
Mr. Huo wants to correct the mistake

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.840
and looking for a replacement.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.320
Prime Minister,

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.519
What do you think?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.200
I was just sick,

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.000
must rest at home.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:57.200
After recovering,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.000
I'm going to the palace to find out.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.600
Well then, have a good rest.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.120
Don't overwork yourself.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.559
It's late,

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:09.120
we said goodbye.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.200
Be careful on the way.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.120
This must be handled with care.

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:30.159
Just follow the Commander-in-Chief's orders.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.600
Oh,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.360
this charge of rebellion

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.799
can sentence
nine generations of relatives to death.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.440
Of course it's a big crime.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:42.000
However, until now,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.200
Commander-in-Chief

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360
not come alone.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.559
Just tell Tian to deliver the message.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.200
Do you think he asked for your opinion?

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.240
Just to tell you clearly,

00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:56.200
to be prepared

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:57.759
and choose a side as soon as possible.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.120
If you choose wrong,

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:01.679
when the Commander-in-Chief is successful,

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:03.600
that's when your head will be cut off.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.120
Tuan Huo.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.519
Problems in Wucheng Village,

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:14.120
I've investigated almost everything.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.919
Say it.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.399
Di Desa Wucheng,

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:18.000
there are many wandering knights
with unclear identities.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480
There are quite a lot of them.

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.600
Their self-defense skills
are also quite high.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.840
There could be a government fugitive
in disguise among them.

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.159
De Jiu has a close relationship
with them.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.000
Uncle Seperguruan.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:29.200
Please help the heroes.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.840
Success or failure
depends on this step.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.480
More importantly...

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.440
Wang Heng is also related
to them, right?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.919
Correct.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.320
I am worried...

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.840
We can't let them
live anymore.

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.519
I'm willing to go and eradicate them.

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:45.000
Good.

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:46.480
Wait for my orders.
