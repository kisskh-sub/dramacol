WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.720
Wouldn’t it be nice?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.720
If we didn’t have to
hide every time we’re together.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120
And never had to worry behind our backs

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.200
about what the other might be planning.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.440
Do you have the numbers yet?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.120
So that means right now

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.880
Khun Ai already knows
Superior’s numbers,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.040
but told your boss you didn’t, right?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.200
Mm.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.880
I’ll send you to help Aiwarin

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.480
dig out Superior’s numbers.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.760
I was forced to hurt Khun Ai

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.560
and you too.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.800
(Khun Ai)

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.080
You came to take this back, didn’t you?

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.600
Since when?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.840
I asked, since when?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.720
A long time ago.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.920
But

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.680
Khun Mae knows it isn’t right.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.240
And you haven’t used it
to dig up secrets in ages.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.480
Then why not take it out?

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.000
You’ve got a keycard to my room.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.040
You could come get it anytime.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.160
Why wait until I found it?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.480
Please, just listen first.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.640
The truth is

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.400
Never mind.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.200
Anyway

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.720
I’ll try to understand you.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880
Because I know

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
why you did what you did.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.560
But you’ll have to accept it too

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.800
if I tell you that I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120
did the same as you.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.880
Khun Ai, what do you mean?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.760
I don’t know exactly

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
what you’ve learned about Orienna.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.960
But I myself

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.800
got important info from Superior too.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.760
What info?

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.880
The numbers you plan
to propose to The Greater.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.600
Twenty-six billion.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.800
Khun Ai

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.040
I told you already,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.240
you’ll have to accept it.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.200
I dug out secrets from you.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.680
You dug out secrets from me.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.079
That’s all our relationship amounts to.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960
Alright.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.040
If this is how it has to be, fine.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.800
Because the truth is,
we came to each other

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.080
both chasing our own gains, didn’t we?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.320
Then it’s about time

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.520
we both face reality.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.760
Stop deceiving each other.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800
And finally step back into being open rivals.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.280
That’s how you see it too, right?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.920
Yes.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.360
From now on,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.360
we’ll have no other role

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.840
but to be competitors.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.640
And remember this, Aiwarin,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.240
you’ll never beat me.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.160
You’re awake?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.040
Come have a bite first.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.960
You

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.120
If you’re still scared of Attawit’s threats,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.720
you can stay with me for now.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.760
Thanks.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800
But I’m not scared anymore.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.080
Why not?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.560
Because I know

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.160
I don’t have to go through this alone.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.400
Because I have you with me.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.440
Besides,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.000
if I run, I’d have to run forever.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.720
So I figured whatever happens, let it happen.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.400
Oh?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.960
You’re tougher now,
so different from last night.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.280
Yeah, maybe I was possessed then.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.800
Did some reckless things.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.040
So the spirit’s gone now?

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.120
Are you groping me?

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.720
Groping what?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.160
You’re eating so messy, like a kid.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.680
A kid, huh?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.040
Mhm.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.760
Eat properly.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.280
Got it.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.160
Want some pork?

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.760
No, I’ll get fat.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.200
I can’t even finish this.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.880
Wow, you

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.000
With that portion,
just give it all to me, huh?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.840
- Then let’s swap plates.
- No way.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.680
This much is enough, or I’ll get fat.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.680
Hold on a sec.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.520
Set up a meeting with
the bidding team for me.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.240
This morning, please.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.920
What is it?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.280
Khun Attawit called
an urgent meeting this morning.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.320
Good.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160
From now on,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.760
I’ll keep the promise I made to you.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.600
That won’t be necessary.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.320
Things between Ai and her are over.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.320
Twenty-six billion.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.000
That’s the number Superior
will propose to The Greater.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.480
Sir, where did we get this number from?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.240
It was Aiwarin’s doing.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.080
Not disappointed, are you?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200
As we know,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.600
if we still propose twenty-four billion,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.720
like we first intended,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.360
we’ll surely lose.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.080
Therefore,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.280
I will propose

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.880
thirty billion.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.880
What do you think, Aiwarin?

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.840
Whatever you see fit, Father.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.440
Then it’s settled.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.560
Handle the documents for me.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.120
Yes.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.160
Aside from the numbers,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.760
is there anything else we need to fix

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.560
or dig up?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.360
Not anymore, sir. Everything’s ready.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.920
We just have to wait and see

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.440
if The Greater adds any conditions

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.920
after the final briefing.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.360
Okay, I understand.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.960
In the meantime,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.880
bring all the documents to me.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.720
If there’s anything to fix,
we’ll fix it in the meeting.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.320
If not, then seal the documents

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.320
and wait for submission day.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.200
Khun Ai, what happened?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.760
We’re going to change the bid number.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.640
When The Greater officially
announced all the bidders,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.440
I studied every competing company.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.680
I found that some companies

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.160
are likely to go higher
than we anticipated.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.800
If we stick to the old number,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.280
Superior has a high chance of losing.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.000
So we need to adjust our number higher.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.120
And how can you be sure, Khun Mae,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.200
that our new number will top the others?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.800
I’m not sure at all.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.120
But it’s better than
sticking to the old number.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.720
So how much will you raise it, Khun Mae?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.720
We have to decide quickly.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.160
Yes. I’ll inform everyone right away.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.000
From the data, there are two companies
to watch out for.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.600
For Great & Glow and Orienna,
I’ve studied them.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.160
Orienna will likely go around
twenty-eight to thirty billion.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.960
As for Great & Glow,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.960
they’re expected to use around
twenty-eight billion as well.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.680
Then what about our current partner?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.120
If the old partner disagrees
with our proposal,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.160
we’ll have to find a new partner
to invest with us.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.960
As for our company,
I estimate we’ll raise by ten percent.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.880
That might be around thirty-one billion.
What do you think?

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.240
Khun Mae

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.200
What made you decide
to change the number?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.560
Aiwarin knows our number.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.560
I can’t believe you’d do this to Khun Ai.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.800
I can’t believe it either,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.600
that you said Khun Ai
already knew Superior’s number

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.600
but chose to stay silent.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.480
Well, Khun Mae did it to Khun Ai first.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.240
How could Ai just stand by?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.680
Don’t blame Khun Mae.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.080
I’m the one who told her.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.240
I’m the one who had the bug
planted in Khun Ai’s room.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.920
If you’re going to blame someone,

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.480
blame me.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.920
Honestly?

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.839
I really want to curse you out.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.599
But I can’t.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.880
Because I do understand why you did it.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.040
But

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.720
is there anything else you’ve done
that I don’t know about?

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.640
No. That’s all.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.040
But I really do want
to apologize to Khun Ai.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.800
It’s too late now.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.280
Things are this heated,
no one’s listening to us anymore.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.760
Hello.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.200
Cheers.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.560
Khun Ai

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.840
I’m sorry, I need to talk to my boss.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.480
Khun Ai

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.400
Do you even realize what you’re doing?

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.880
If anyone sees, it won’t look good.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.360
That’s enough, Khun Ai.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.920
Stay out of my way.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.400
Won’t you let me be happy, just once?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.040
Let me ask you straight, Yam.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.480
Do you really think

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.040
Do you think Khun Mae really meant
to hurt you?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.320
I don’t know either.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.520
But sometimes I wonder

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.200
when I saw that bugging device,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.880
and if she hadn’t come to me then,

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.120
I

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.680
I might have just

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.200
pretended I never saw it.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.160
If I had a choice

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.640
you wouldn’t want things
to end like this, would you, Khun Ai?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.840
But I’ve no face left to hold on to her.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.960
Because I hurt her too.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.440
It’s okay.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.520
Do you like it?

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.080
If you do, I’ll do this every day.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.080
I can, you know.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.520
You’re happy, right, Khun Ai?

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.880
That you’re with Khun Mae?

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.080
And no matter how the bidding turns out,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.120
we won’t let it decide

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.200
what happens between us.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.120
Can we?

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.920
Promise me, Khun Ai.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.000
(Tomorrow: bidder briefing session)

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.720
Hello, sir.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.560
You came alone, Khun Mae?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.640
Yes, I came alone.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.640
I don’t really have anyone close
to me at the bidding,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.440
unlike you.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.200
I meant your assistant.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.440
Mm, she didn’t come.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.280
And Aiwarin?

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.400
You must be referring to the news, right?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.600
I’m surprised, honestly.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.200
You seem like someone experienced,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.080
who’s been through a lot.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.760
Didn’t think you’d believe
something so easily.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.120
I don’t believe that easily.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.480
Maybe it’s because
I’ve been through a lot.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.480
It’s taught me that anything can happen.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.480
The bidding procedures and conditions

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.240
are in the documents you’ve all received.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.280
And our project

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.840
will shortlist the two best offers.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.760
After that, we’ll announce the concession
winner in front of the media.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.160
Let me remind everyone,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.640
please review the conditions carefully.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.920
The winner must put down
a 10% contract guarantee.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.960
Everyone now has the full details.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.320
This concludes the final briefing.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.280
And I’m sure you’ve seen
how hard we’ve tried

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.640
to make everything turn out the best it can.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.480
As the project chairman,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.760
I assure you I will protect
the interests of all parties

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.280
to the fullest.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.440
If anyone has questions,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.000
or any points you’re
still unclear on, please ask now.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.040
Are you sure

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.760
you’ll really protect everyone’s interests?

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.200
I’ll take that question

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.120
as you doubting me.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.480
I was only asking

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.280
to give you the chance to answer.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.880
So you could reassure certain people

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.040
who might be doubting you.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.840
Give them confidence again.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.440
Who exactly do you mean?

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.720
Some of the bidders here,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.520
the ones you seem especially close to.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.120
Excuse me, Khun Maevika,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.280
but I think we’ve wasted
enough time on trivial matters.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.920
Let’s move on to others
who may have questions.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.320
Uh, excuse me a moment.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.880
We’ll send out an initial notice by email.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.080
As for

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.600
I understand. You must think
the number we’re about to submit

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.600
You think it’s too high, don’t you?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.680
But this number isn’t
just about beating Superior

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.680
or any other rivals.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.640
It’s a declaration,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.680
of how ready Orienna is
to handle this concession.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.120
So thirty billion

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.120
is the most reasonable figure.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.040
Khun Mae.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.680
Why are you following me?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200
I just came to tell you

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.440
that back in the conference room,
you crossed the line.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.880
That’s not true.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.360
I was trying to stop you.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.760
I already told you, didn’t I?

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.000
Don’t let others see too much
of your thoughts and feelings,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.880
what’s really on your mind.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.640
And if you’re going to play
with those who play dirty,

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.280
you need to wait
for the right time. Don’t rush.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.960
Or you’ll be the one who gets burned.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.800
You sound like you actually care about me.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600
Don’t worry about me.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.760
Because if anything happens,

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.120
I can take responsibility for myself.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.920
And don’t you forget,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.280
that you and I are still rivals.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.240
Honorable committee from The Greater,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.720
we’ve already placed the 10% deposit.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.880
May I ask what benefits we’ll receive?

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.840
May I also ask, does The Greater

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.240
have any criteria for reviewing performance?

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.000
Next piece of evidence, please.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.520
It looks like those two women know too much.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.760
We need to deal with them quickly.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.080
But this number isn’t
just about beating Superior

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.080
or any other rivals.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.320
It’s a declaration of how ready Orienna

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.160
is to handle this concession.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.520
So thirty billion

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.480
is the most reasonable figure.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.760
(Unknown number)

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.240
Hello?

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.160
Meet me, unless you want your boss in trouble.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.040
Who are you?

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.920
Sir.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.600
Hello, Jirana,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.400
Khun Maevika’s secretary.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.880
I was being polite.
You could at least respond.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400
I have manners,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.120
but only for people who deserve them.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.360
You’re just as cocky as your boss.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.800
Don’t you dare touch Khun Mae!

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.360
And why not?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.280
I already did.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.680
Don’t tell me,

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.640
you’re the one who leaked the news?

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.040
That’s right.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.040
And it pisses me off
that nothing’s blown up yet.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.040
That’s why I had you come here.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.680
What do you want?

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.080
Proof.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.280
Something concrete enough to prove

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.480
that Maevika and Aiwarin are deeply involved.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.040
But don’t worry,

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.560
I won’t leak the clip anywhere.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.080
I’ll just use it to scare them

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.440
into backing out of the bidding.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.240
Give it up.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.120
Someone like me would
never betray my boss.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.680
But if you don’t,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.800
Maevika’s going to suffer even more.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.240
And if you’re smart enough,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.080
you’d know what matters more,

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.400
the bidding

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.160
or your boss’s life.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.680
- You bastard!
- I can be worse.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.080
I just haven’t felt like it yet.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.720
Relax. I promise you,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.320
I’ll only use the evidence to threaten them.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.760
All I want is to win the bid.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.200
After that, we go our separate ways.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.159
It’s all done.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.159
Can you give me a hint?

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.520
Please.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.080
At this point, our committee

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.840
has received sealed bids
from all companies.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.200
Please trust in our process,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.520
we’ll judge everything fairly

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.360
and with full transparency.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.680
Excuse me, sir.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.880
I can’t be certain

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.280
that this bidding process is truly fair

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.920
if we continue to overlook certain matters.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.360
Not long ago,

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.760
everyone must have seen
the rumors about Aiwarin of Orienna

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.400
and Maevika of Superior.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.760
But those rumors vanished suspiciously fast,

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.480
which makes me wonder,

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.400
was someone using
their power to bury the truth,

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.200
because they knew it wasn’t just a rumor?

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.240
It’s the truth.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.400
What I want everyone to understand

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.080
is that we can’t just let this slide.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.440
Especially The Greater,
who should be taking action.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.480
What do you mean, Khun Rachen?

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.600
If society has doubts

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.920
about possible misconduct or corruption,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.720
about collusion to exploit
the bidding process,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.760
then The Greater should investigate.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.640
And if there’s truth to it,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.120
Orienna and Superior should be
disqualified from bidding.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.520
Khun Rachen,

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.520
you can’t just make
accusations without evidence.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.560
Even if I don’t have evidence,

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.880
if there are suspicions,

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.600
there should be action
taken for fairness, right?

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.800
Khun Direk, please consider this.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.680
Khun Mae

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.680
- Khun Mae.
- P’G.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.280
What happened?

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.280
It’s serious.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.320
Hey!

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.440
I’m sorry.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.200
I shouldn’t have even thought of doing that.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.040
It’s because Rachen threatened to hurt you.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.040
It’s really okay, P’G.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.760
I’m just so glad you made it back safely.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.520
Rachen is truly vicious.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.480
Khun Mae

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.200
from now on you really need to be careful.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.520
I’m sure Rachen won’t let you
and Khun Ai go so easily.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.680
We need to talk, Khun Aiwarin.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.280
So you think you can
discredit anyone you want

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.240
without having any solid proof?

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.960
In some cases,

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.800
suspicion alone

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.880
is enough not to ignore it.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.280
That’s true.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.040
And if there’s solid proof,

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.160
then it’s even harder to ignore.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.320
Maevika’s not that clever.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.320
But no matter, I already
prepared a backup plan.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.720
- What kind?
- With your help, of course.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.880
And what more do you want me to do?

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.840
I’ve already done plenty
planning everything for you.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.000
Any more and it’s too risky for me too.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
But I’ve compensated
you well enough, haven’t I?

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.120
With what I’ve already paid,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.320
and what I’ll be paying
after the bidding ends.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.000
- Khun Rachen.
- Khun Rachen.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.840
- May we get an interview?
- Not possible.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.400
- What’s going on?
- How could this happen?

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.160
Calm down, please. Calm down.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.600
No filming, no photos.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.520
It’s not me, listen first.
And no photos.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.360
- Khun Rachen!
- What’s really happening?

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.560
- Is it true?
- Is it real?

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.880
Calm down, everyone.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.920
Let go of me.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.400
Don’t forget yourself.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.600
And stop treating me like before.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.680
I haven’t forgotten.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.680
I meant to.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.000
I tried to stop myself.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.160
But I couldn’t.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.640
I still want you close.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.720
I still want to hold you.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.560
I still want to spend time with you.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.200
I never wanted it to end like this.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.200
But wanting is all it is.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.000
In the end, there’s nothing we can do.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.320
You’ve seen it yourself,

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.240
the place we’re in

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.440
forces us to hurt each other this much.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.440
And the ones who bleed
are just the two of us.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.800
So

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.440
ending it this way

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.280
is for the best, Khun Aiwarin.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.880
(Scandal Exposed: Great & Glow tied
to secret deal, Direk ousted as chairman)

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.240
I won’t let you two get away with this!

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.040
I’m fine, P’G.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.560
I made the right decision.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.320
This is how it has to be,
this is what’s right.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.360
That’s all for now.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.240
I didn’t forget. I meant to.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.080
I tried to stop myself.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.280
But I couldn’t.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.200
I still want you close.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.760
I still want to spend time with you.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.200
And I never wanted it to end like this.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.520
Excuse me.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.640
One more Beautyful Trap, please.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.720
Sorry.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.400
She’s with me.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.800
I’ll take care of her.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.360
You.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.080
You.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.320
You.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.640
Go now.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.360
Slowly.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.000
You.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.280
(Khun Ai)

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.160
(Khun Ai)

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.640
Welcome to the voicemail service.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.320
Please leave your message after the tone.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.880
Well?

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.440
They’re still meeting in secret, sir.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.840
Do you want photos to use for blackmail?

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.320
I’d like to thank everyone

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.080
for being here as witnesses

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.200
to the announcement of the winning bid

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.560
for The Greater Duty Free today.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.240
What kind of person are you, really?

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.200
Playing dirty with me
until the very last second?

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.280
Don’t overthink it.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.960
Whatever they decide

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.600
won’t affect us.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.360
They’re both bound to get hurt.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.720
So how could we allow
ourselves to be happy?

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.280
You can break up with me if you want.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.360
I’ll still be waiting in my place,

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.920
waiting for the day you return.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:50.360
But I have you with me.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.520
(But I have you with me.)

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.280
(Don’t shame the name of a bodyguard.)

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.320
Forget it.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.200
My voice cracked just now.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.920
From now on, there’s nothing between us

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.280
except being rivals.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.240
Let me go now.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.240
(Tough day, huh?)
