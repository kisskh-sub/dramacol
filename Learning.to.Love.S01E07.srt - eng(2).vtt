WEBVTT

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.338
TAKE CARE, MISS.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:09.776
So we're putting a period
on our relationship after today?

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.850
{\an8}We received a call from a parent asking
about your relationship with the host.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.852
It's called seductive marketing, right?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.054
I am a host through and through.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.390
I'll do anything
to make my princesses happy.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.290
Hey!

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.358
Here!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.674
- Lowering the stretcher!
- Okay!

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.379
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.214
Can you hear me?

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.316
I'm going to touch you, okay?

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.989
- Ouch!
- You fell from up there?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.958
We'll take you to the hospital now!

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.261
No, thank you!

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.629
That doesn't work for me…

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:03.863
- Don't move!
- Ow!

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.466
Do you have any family members
we can contact?

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.101
No, I don't.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.570
- I'm fine, really!
- Be careful!

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.014
Please stay conscious!

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.450
PIETAS GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.356
They've been waiting a long time.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.195
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting!

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:40.400
I'm very sorry to have caused you worry!

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.169
We were not worried about you!

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.942
Is it true that you're dating
a host from Kabukicho?

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:54.280
My daughter saw you talking to him
intimately at the school gate.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.825
It's true that I was meeting up with him.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:11.097
He never went to school properly,
so I was teaching him literacy skills.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.737
Sorry to interrupt,
but she is telling the truth.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.206
She asked me for some advice.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:24.477
Shouldn't you be focused
on teaching your homeroom students?

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:28.615
Letting your guard down around someone
who tricks women for profit…

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.751
You should be ashamed of yourself!
It's unacceptable!

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.786
- We're very sorry!
- Wait a minute.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.189
- Mr. Takamori is…
- Ms. Ogawa.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.162
I understand why you're upset,

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.798
but I have already told him
that I cannot see him again

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.234
to avoid misunderstandings like this.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.140
However, I do apologize
for my thoughtless behavior.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.077
So it's a misunderstanding?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.117
If so, Ms. Ogawa,
can you write a signed promise?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.952
A signed promise?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.556
Although you might think
seeing a host isn't breaking any laws,

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:14.194
the entertainment business act law
was revised with stricter sanctions

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.030
due to the large number of victims
created by the industry.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.600
The promise should say,

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:26.172
"As a teacher and a mentor to minors,
I will never again be involved

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.978
with people who work at host clubs
which are deemed evil under social norms."

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.183
Understood.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.452
Let's go.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.823
I'm so sorry about this.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.258
My apologies.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.473
NISHI-SHINJUKU GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.309
Lucky you didn't need surgery.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.479
I'm fine! Everyone is overreacting.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.382
I'll be out of here in no time… Ouch!

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:14.554
You have a fractured rib
and some bleeding in your brain.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.289
You have to rest for a few days.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.124
Okay.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:23.997
Whatever you tell me to do,
Ms. Kawaguchi, I will listen.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.366
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.068
- Sorry to intrude.
- Excuse me.

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:36.376
Are you Mr. Taiga Takamori,
also known as Kaoru from JOKER?

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.878
I'm Kurosaki, Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.982
A hospital visit from the police?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.984
What an honor.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:50.623
I heard you asked to be transferred from
a hospital in Miura City to one in Tokyo?

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.892
Seems like you're injured pretty badly.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.096
Did you get into a fight
with someone in Miura City?

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.599
No, I fell. It was my fault.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.601
Is that so?

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:05.171
- Who did you go there with?
- By myself!

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.472
To see the ocean.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:10.543
Hosts need breaks too, you know.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.247
If you got caught up in trouble,
we'd like for you to report it.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.616
As I said, it wasn't like that!

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.284
Are you done?

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:22.221
You cops always assume it's a crime
the moment you hear a host was injured.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:26.492
Contact us anytime
if you remember anything.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:30.096
- Thank you for your time.
- Excuse me.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.904
So condescending!

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.940
Hosts aren't liked too much by society.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.608
- Ouch!
- Are you okay?

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:43.509
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:46.679
- I brought you some stuff you might need.
- Thank you!

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:49.782
What are these?

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.551
They're so cool!

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:54.387
Something suitable
for the number one host-to-be!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.155
These are amazing!

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:58.224
All the nurses will fall for me!

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.860
- Great! They can come and nominate you!
- Oh, wow!

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.528
This is the best gift ever!

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:04.497
So, tell me the truth.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.733
Huh?

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:11.170
It's me after all!

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.707
Who were you with?
You even took a day off work.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.381
- Ms. Chihuahua.
- I knew it!

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:23.816
How did you get injured?

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.286
After we said goodbye,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.423
I missed a step on the pedestrian bridge.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.394
You do often fall over
even when you're dancing!

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.597
Stop! Don't make fun of me.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.533
Seriously…

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.669
So, why didn't you come back
together if it was a date?

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.605
Why all the questions?

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:50.243
We decided not to meet again.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:52.979
Last date at the beach?

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.348
You guys are like high schoolers!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.916
Anyway…

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:58.384
I fell, okay?

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:05.258
Don't tell anyone,
especially her, that I got injured.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.427
Noted!

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.530
- They don't suit you.
- What! Why?

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:14.000
- Could you check the materials I made?
- Sure.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.836
This looks good.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:20.473
- It's well made. Perfect!
- Really? Thank you.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:44.096
MIURA BEACH PEDESTRIAN CROSSING HOST FALLS

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.601
WEATHER FORECAST IN MIURA CITY

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.537
FISHING OR PHOTO SPOTS IN MIURA
BEST PLACE TO EAT IN MIURA

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:04.717
I'M SORRY I MADE YOU WORRY

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:06.619
I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY! GET SOME REST

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:09.722
ARE YOU AT SCHOOL TODAY?

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:19.832
HOST CLUBS WHICH ARE DEEMED EVIL

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:33.546
ARE YOU AT SCHOOL TODAY?
HOW ABOUT DINNER AFTER WORK?

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.288
I'M SORRY

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.691
I HAD SOME ISSUES AT WORK
SO I DON'T THINK I CAN

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:47.326
Issues?

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.032
Good morning!

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.773
The first half of the fiscal year
will be ending in a month.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.743
Our fund wrap target
will not be met at this rate.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.148
Please report the status of your projects
in the pipeline list, so we can discuss

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.952
how to meet the targets
in our full-year financial results.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.488
Could you start us off, Mr. Takei?

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.823
I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU TODAY!
HOW ABOUT TEA?

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.727
I got all-you-can-drink.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.731
What issues did you have?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.135
Just with some parents.

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.905
I see. Your student's parents?

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:38.711
Must be tough dealing
with that during summer break.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:42.415
Not at all. I have a long way
to go to earn my students' trust.

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.916
I admire your efforts!

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.652
I only care about my own results.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:50.022
It's hard for me to think
about my customers.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:53.593
As a bankman
I should think about them more.

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.761
They entrust me with their lives.

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.430
What happened to your hand?

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.902
Oh, I fell down and landed
on my hand, and it fractured.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.538
Your right hand… How inconvenient!

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:07.640
It's a first for me.

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.475
But don't worry, I'm fine!

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.243
By the way…

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:14.647
How is it going
with that host called Kaoru?

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:18.284
I'm never seeing him again.

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.186
I told him so.

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:22.355
When?

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:23.389
What?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.625
Yesterday.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:26.726
Yesterday.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.427
I see.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:33.566
And did he agree?

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:40.640
As in, he's a host after all,
so you know, he might get pushy.

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.241
I doubt that.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.677
Yes, he is a host.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:49.749
But he wasn't the type
to ruin someone's life.

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:53.085
Don't defend him! That's super annoying!

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.323
I'm joking!

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.492
I'm glad he wasn't a weird guy!

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:04.330
I'm actually quite timid, so…

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:09.235
I tend to worry too much
especially about you.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.773
I'm sorry for causing you
unnecessary stress and worries.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:19.211
But I mean it!
I'm not going to see him again.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.581
Really?

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.218
- Yes.
- Okay, cool.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.321
I'll get you a drink. Hot coffee?

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:33.259
- I can get it myself! You're injured!
- No, I'm fine!

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.764
I want to love him properly.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:43.402
I want to cherish him.
He waited patiently for my selfish self.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.640
I guess that's solved.

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.476
Oh, hot water!

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.011
Ouch, that's hot!

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.015
Taiga!

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.316
Yuki!

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.452
Wow, you have so much energy!

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:03.222
It was quite a shock
getting a call from the hospital.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.225
I was told I need someone
to prove my identity.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.060
Sorry for being a nuisance.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:11.363
I never said that. Don't be so cynical.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.433
- Are you okay?
- What? Yeah, totally!

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.603
It's just an injury,
so I'll be out of here soon.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.673
- Taiga, I really like this book.
- What?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.574
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.477
"The lion accidentally stepped into a trap

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:27.079
set up by humans!"

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:29.648
Are you curious
about what will happen too?

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:33.285
I'm glad.

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.824
If you open the fridge there,
you should find your favorite juice.

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.026
- Lots of them!
- Cool!

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:49.335
You got injured at Miura Beach, I heard?

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.906
You remembered going there with me?

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:57.176
You were so cute back then!

00:12:57.243 --> 00:12:59.578
Yet I had to go there
so you can see a guy.

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.647
I treated you to ice cream, didn't I?

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:04.817
Treated?

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:13.125
You seem to think
that I'm a terrible mother,

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.761
but I was hurt too, you know.

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:21.200
I didn't get to graduate from high school,
so I wanted my kids to go to university.

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:27.673
But as soon as you entered
elementary school, you were quite a…

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:32.044
I was shocked.
I felt like my dream was crushed.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.381
I didn't know what to do.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:40.119
- I bet my dad was dumb too.
- No, not at all.

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:42.688
He was very clever, actually.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.592
Well, sorry I disappointed you.

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:51.263
By the way,
that lady you brought with you,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.098
is she really your teacher?

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:58.003
Being a host isn't easy, huh?

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:02.575
Having to butter up such boring girls
so that they pay your salary.

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:05.010
Who's the one who can't live
without my salary?

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:07.246
Taiga.

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:15.654
The three million yen he asked you for
it can wait until you're better.

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:23.929
So get better soon
and become number one, okay?

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:29.401
Taiga! What's this?

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:35.741
That's something very important to me.

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.577
I'm back!

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:40.846
Welcome back.

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:45.818
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
I'm just about to start cooking.

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.189
Sorry.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:52.558
I've eaten already, actually.

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.228
Was there an issue at school?

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.632
Tell me. I can be of help.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.569
It's okay, I can resolve it on my own.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.437
Can you?

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:08.908
Of course, she can!

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.209
Trust your daughter.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:14.280
How can I trust her? She's been infatuated
with a host while being engaged!

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:21.220
I heard you weren't
at Miura Beach with Yoji.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.724
You teach at a girls' school.

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:30.329
Not only would you get fired,
it could become news!

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.100
I've been debating whether
or not to go to the police first,

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.636
and haven't been to work
the last few days.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.508
Is what I did really that bad?

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:44.243
Manami.

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:50.649
You are a kind person
but you lack self-awareness.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:53.285
It's your fatal flaw.

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.521
Don't just assume that!

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:58.424
I know you more than you know yourself!

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.592
I've known you since you were in diapers--

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.329
Stop it! Don't talk about diapers to me!

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.766
Manami.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.036
TAIGA TAKAMORI

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:09.094
Hello? It's me, Ogawa!

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:13.932
I…

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:18.570
I know I shouldn't call you, but…

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:22.074
my family and the school know about us,

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.476
and it became an issue.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.212
So someone might contact
your workplace too.

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.483
Okay.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.885
I'm sorry.

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.953
I just wanted to let you know!

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.423
Thank you.

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:40.025
MS. CHIHUAHUA

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.380
Why were you waiting outside, you dummy?

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.116
I wish you had called me!

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:39.351
I didn't want to disturb your work.

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.787
You've always been this way.

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:46.358
- You keep waiting silently and creepily.
- Creepily?

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.193
That's mean.

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:52.865
What were you going to do
if I came back with a guy?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.100
You don't have a guy.

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.835
Now that's mean!

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:02.007
What is it? Something serious?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.546
I went to Miura Beach
with Mr. Takamori yesterday.

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.382
With Kaoru?

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:12.584
Like a date?

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.420
Our first and last date.

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.890
What if people find out?

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.525
Yeah.

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:22.628
My family and the school found out.

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.900
"Don't get involved with those
deemed evil under social norms."

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:37.075
So you had to write
a signed promise this time?

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.547
Well, this is how society
views your relationship.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.450
I was so frustrated.

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:52.257
I…

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:56.528
I think I had actually fallen for him.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:57.796
You had?

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.067
Yeah. I’m not going to see him again.

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.571
I just wanted
to talk to someone, that's all.

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:08.106
He's over me already, anyway.

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:09.408
Over you?

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:13.245
It's probably no big deal
for Kaoru, you know.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.814
Make-believe romances
are part of their job.

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:19.151
Hey, do you still not get it?

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.520
You're addicted to a host.

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.488
You're seconds away from going crazy!

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.757
Nine, eight, seven, six…

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:28.327
All women who get addicted to them say,

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:33.465
"No, he's one of the good ones!
He really loves me, and only me!"

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:35.500
And watch their life fall apart.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:43.141
Manami, I'm not kidding when I say
you will lose everything.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.277
Is that okay?

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:53.051
If you say you don't mind that,
then I will support you!

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:59.591
As I said,
I'm never going to see him again!

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:00.759
Calm down.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.335
I'll be right back.

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:17.209
Kaoru told me
that he just missed a step and fell.

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:22.414
He told us so too, but…

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:27.452
What do you think has happened,
Mr. Kurosaki?

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:33.492
We think he possibly got pushed
down the stairs by a certain person.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:34.693
A certain person?

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.364
The investigation
into the murdered host is going well.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:40.666
No.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.970
I doubt that Kaoru's done anything
to put his life in danger.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.107
I've known you for a long time,
so let me give you a warning.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.012
If this person turns up here,
be on the alert.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.449
And please report to us immediately.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.024
- Okay then. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.201
I WILL NEVER BE INVOLVED WITH PEOPLE
WHO WORK AT HOST CLUBS

00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:18.003
WHICH ARE DEEMED EVIL UNDER SOCIAL NORMS

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.505
Ms. Ogawa.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.878
Did you do it out of compassion
for the unprivileged boy?

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:32.050
Or was it to fulfill your own desire?

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:33.919
I just wanted him to--

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.921
You don't have to answer right now.

00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:42.027
I'm also a woman.

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.964
I have many occasions
when I have to overcome desires.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:52.237
When that happens, I ask myself
the question I just asked you.

00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:57.609
And when I do so, I know what to do.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:22:59.845
I see.

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:02.214
Ms. Ogawa.

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:05.050
I believe in you.

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:07.652
Thank you.

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:19.865
Ms. Sawaguchi is in the library studying.

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:23.301
Thank you.

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.842
- Ms. Sawaguchi.
- Don't come near me.

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:38.617
I'm sorry for acting
carelessly the other day.

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.753
I don't want your apology.

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:46.691
"I'm addicted to a host
I used to criticize."

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:51.163
"I've spent so much money
and I'm up to my eyeballs in debt."

00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:55.467
If you came crying, admitting to that,
it would be easier to forgive.

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:16.388
Oh, hi. Sorry to disturb you.

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.256
Is this about Manami again?

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.726
- Don't you have to work?
- I do work hard!

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:24.596
I even got told
I will definitely get promoted soon!

00:24:24.663 --> 00:24:26.164
The executives said so, too!

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:30.502
It is prime time for me
to take care of my fiancé's matter.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.003
So, what is it this time?

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:36.475
Manami went to Miura Beach with Kaoru.

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:41.480
How do you know that?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.918
Manami's mom called
because the school was looking for Manami.

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:53.558
And? Did you get angry
and punch a door or something?

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.427
No, nothing like that!

00:24:58.363 --> 00:25:00.131
Tell her you want to call it off!

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:01.166
What?

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:03.368
She might start to want you more.

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:05.770
That's so irresponsible!

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:08.206
Sometimes you need to play hard to get.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:11.376
- Don't you think?
- But I'm not good at that.

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.613
I just hope Kaoru never comes back.

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.215
That's dark.

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:20.952
Also, you're opening up too much to me.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.120
Sorry.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:24.756
I just feel like
I could tell you anything.

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:26.658
You've got to be kidding!

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:28.827
In any case, I can't help you!

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:30.996
- This is about you and Manami.
- But…

00:25:31.062 --> 00:25:33.565
- Bye! Oh, and by the way--
- Oh, wait!

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.867
Don't come back here, okay? I'm busy.

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.340
"Never comes back"?

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.213
What does that mean?

00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:52.317
Oh wow, I did not expect you to visit me.

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:55.820
- Are you bothered?
- Well, a bit.

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.924
- What's that?
- Shine Muscat grapes.

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:02.594
They're in high demand now, just like us.

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:10.201
I hope you're not making
too much profit while I'm not there!

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:12.938
It'll be hard to catch up.

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.639
These look good.

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:16.207
I can't help it.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.811
People keep nominating me,
keeping me busy.

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:26.184
I need you back.
It's boring without a good competitor.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.687
You don't have to tell me that!

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.424
Police officers came to the club.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.195
They think this is related
to the murdered host's case.

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:39.464
It's not related.

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:45.236
If you don't give them the details,
they'll keep bothering the club.

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:51.743
Hey.

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:57.983
You're a jerk,
but you're good at keeping secrets.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.152
I've never told anyone
my customers' secrets.

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:08.860
Actually, I got pushed.

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:15.000
But it was by someone
unrelated to the club.

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:19.804
I kind of feel bad for them,
so I don't want to report it.

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.213
You really are an idiot.

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.781
Shut up.

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.917
Again, don't tell anyone! Okay?

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:37.589
In exchange,
should I tell you one of my secrets?

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.557
Yeah? Sounds good to me!

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:42.827
I think…

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.930
I'm being targeted.

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.867
What? Really?

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:51.469
By who?

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.374
A woman who can't seem to let go of me.

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:59.077
I almost took you seriously!

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:04.916
Take care.

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:22.801
Ms. Momoko.

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.203
- You can go.
- Thanks for the drink.

00:28:25.937 --> 00:28:27.772
Thank you for the nomination.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.541
Here for an interview?

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.409
Thanks for the other day.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.511
I have more questions.

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:37.916
Why do so many women
get addicted to host clubs

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.819
although they're considered problematic?

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.822
I want to delve into their mindset.

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:46.891
Sounds interesting.

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:50.128
Maybe you should get addicted to find out?

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:52.430
I can help you.

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:56.167
You're such a smooth talker.

00:28:57.368 --> 00:28:59.504
Show me what you got.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:08.313
Let me be frank.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.853
I really like you.

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:20.692
Nope, no butterflies!

00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:25.363
Tell the truth.
You're just worried about your friend.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.534
Wow, I guess the number one host
really does have good intuition!

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:34.105
Kaoru's in a hospital right now.

00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:35.740
Hospital?

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:40.779
He fell and got injured quite badly.

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.414
He might not be able to come back.

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:45.250
How did he fall?

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:47.252
I don't know.

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:49.420
I heard he went to a beach.

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:51.489
A beach.

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:55.460
Is it possible…

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:04.469
I feel drunk.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.673
- You rarely drink this much.
- Yeah.

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:13.978
Do you think…

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.850
we should get married?

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:20.685
What?

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:24.923
I just feel like we're forcing ourselves
into marriage.

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:27.592
That's not true! It's just me…

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.360
I'm being indecisive.

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.262
Tell her you want to call it off!

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:36.901
I honestly do like you.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.873
You're the first person
I've wanted to marry.

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:45.543
But when I took a step back…

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:53.451
I started thinking maybe I should
let you go if I'm causing you distress.

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:55.587
She might start to want you more.

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.892
I get it.

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:03.995
I'll also take a step back
and have a think.

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:08.700
What's with that reaction?
I saw you looking at him longingly!

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:11.002
- What are you talking about?
- At the station!

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:14.272
I saw you and Kaoru looking
at each other sadly before you parted!

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:30.154
No, I went to look for you
because your mom told me.

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.357
I was worried
you might not be safe with him.

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:35.560
Did I do something wrong?
I don't think I did.

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.161
No, you didn't! But…

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.564
I just wish you had told me sooner!

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:41.032
How could I?

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:43.134
You think I followed you out of jealousy!

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:46.738
I would never get jealous of a host!

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:52.977
I know. You're not that kind of person.

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:58.883
I felt like our last
memory together got tainted.

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.287
But I couldn't say that.

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.190
Because I'm to blame
for going to the beach with him.

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:13.898
I wasn't sure if I should tell you, but…

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:19.771
Kaoru got injured, and he's hospitalized
at Nishi-Shinjuku General Hospital.

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.272
What? Hospitalized?

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.977
He went to a beach
and fell from a height, apparently.

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:30.348
You didn't know?

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:34.018
What kind of injury? How did he fall?

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.421
Was it really just an accident…

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:38.690
What do you mean?

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:48.066
I saw you and Kaoru looking
at each other sadly before you parted!

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.152
HEALTHY LIVING

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:53.331
{\an8}MS. CHIHUAHUA

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.599
{\an8}MISSED CALL

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:19.757
Hello?

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.326
Sorry, did you call me? What's up?

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:25.730
- Well, I'm at…
- I'm at the club right now.

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:27.098
Can you make it quick?

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:28.733
At the club?

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.170
I have so many customers
nominating me one after another.

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.838
I'm doing really well right now.

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:38.876
Well, that's great.

00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:39.911
Yeah.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:43.848
I might actually
become number one this month.

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:48.019
Don't drink too much, okay?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.191
So, why did you call me?
Was it to tell me not to drink too much?

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:59.530
Oh, I know. You wanted to hear my voice
despite saying you'll never see me again.

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:02.567
You're number one
at being full of yourself!

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:05.803
Miss.

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:09.340
If you want to see me,
come to the club now.

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.309
Now?

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.510
Yeah.

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.980
If you order me a tower,
I can spend some time with you.

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.950
- A tower?
- Wait.

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:22.587
Really? You've been around me long enough!

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.956
A tower is a champagne tower!

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.694
I think a million yen one
would be appropriate! Yeah!

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.396
A teacher at a private school
must be well-paid.

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:36.400
And I hope you know,
I can't return it this time.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:41.672
I am a host after all.

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.975
Don't forget that.

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:48.880
I know.

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:53.050
Yes, you are a host.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.487
Always surrounded by beautiful women.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.993
Yes, exactly.

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:06.497
It's a completely different world
from your very serious world.

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.301
You should forget about me already.

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:15.206
I'm sorry for being persistent.

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:18.309
But…

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.813
I'm just happy to hear that you're well.

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:30.221
I need to go do a champagne call.

00:36:30.955 --> 00:36:33.724
Don't call me anymore, okay?

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.626
Bye.

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:54.278
He put on an act for me.

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:58.015
Now I need to move forward too.

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.503
Ouch!

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.095
Hey.

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:22.566
Are you not going to work again today?

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.411
Are you sure…

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:36.747
this is about Manami?

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.350
- Because you're worried about her?
- Yes!

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:46.190
If the school decides to fire her,
I'll need to go talk to the principal.

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:51.362
Maybe it's better
if you don't get involved.

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.097
Good morning!

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.033
Good morning!

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.138
Dad.

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:06.043
I want to apologize for getting
too emotional the other day.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.278
I'm sorry.

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:10.715
I'm glad to hear that.

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:14.352
I'm going to move out.

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.258
I got too comfortable here.

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.993
I need to be more independent.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.595
Why are you moving out?

00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:28.032
Once you marry Yoji,
you'll have to move out anyway.

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.534
- Just wait--
- It has nothing to do with that.

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.169
I just want to move out!

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:37.608
I'll clean my room today
and start apartment hunting.

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:45.783
Apartment hunting?

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:52.056
NISHI-SHINJUKU GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:02.767
- I heard you're getting released today.
- Oh, Boss! Hello.

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:08.139
Thank you for referring me
to this hospital.

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.042
I'll work hard to make up for the loss.

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:13.244
Before that.

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.380
Anything you want to tell me
about your injury?

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.450
No, nothing.

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:24.488
I feel embarrassed about how clumsy I am.

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.791
Kaoru.

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.561
Maybe you should retire as a host.

00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:32.196
What?

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.032
Undisciplined people
will never become number one.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.567
Wait, what?

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:38.569
Retiring from this industry is hard.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.704
Especially for hosts.

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.508
I also had a hard time.

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.946
Sooner the better, okay?

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:52.016
But I want to get to the top as a host!

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.819
Being a host is all I have.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.556
I can change and be more disciplined.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.125
Get better at conversing.

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:06.530
And I'll also work on my appearance
so I can bring in some huge spenders!

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:36.393
- Ms. Akina! We're not open yet!
- Tsubasa.

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:37.928
What?

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.965
There you are.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.299
How can I help you, Miss?

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:44.768
Kaoru is off work today.

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.705
I'm still Tsubasa's biggest customer.

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:50.341
Move!

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:53.577
I need to talk to you.

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:59.617
I don't want to talk to you.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.038
- Whoa!
- Hey! Ms. Akina!

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.406
Ms. Akina.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.109
She's gone mad…

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:27.344
He's in danger.

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.217
Sorry to call you.

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:40.457
Why did you cut me off?

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:46.130
Do you know how much I've spent
to make you number one?

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:50.401
Ms. Akina!

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.138
Let's put that away.

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:58.609
You seem quite drunk.

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:02.446
You're too beautiful to act this way.

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.417
Please?

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.470
Calm down!

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:35.379
Let go of me! Stop it!

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.680
Let go!

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.724
- What should we do?
- Oh, no.

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.597
Thanks.

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:56.500
Kaoru!

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.833
{\an8}Can I come and have a look
at the one in Nakano?

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:31.535
{\an8}Yes!

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.003
{\an8}Yes, please!

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:35.406
{\an8}My name is Manami Ogawa.

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:39.076
{\an8}Yes, I'll head there right now!

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:49.286
{\an8}KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:27.558
I decided to move out.

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:31.929
{\an8}I knew my sudden independence
wouldn't be easy for them.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.898
{\an8}But the memory

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:40.104
{\an8}of being in love with someone
felt enough to be able to live on my own.

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:43.173
So, we drove her into madness?

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.142
We can't justify staying open.

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:46.110
Ms. Chihuahua!

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:48.345
You can't do anything without my help!

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:50.948
That's why I told you I'm moving out!

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:55.953
{\an8}THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
