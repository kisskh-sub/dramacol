00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 12=

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.240
Second Master!

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.920
You must've made money by now.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.000
You still owe me 137 taels of gold.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.359
It's been over a month.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.399
Time to pay up, isn't it?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.359
Get lost!

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.839
Second Master, don't think I don't know.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.239
You made a batch of incense
to sell the other day.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.000
Now it's turned into funeral supplies.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.559
No one's buying.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.240
If I wait for you to sell it

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.320
and pay me back,

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.759
I'll probably be waiting until

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:38.799
my son burns Suhe Luo at my funeral!

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.399
You'd better pay me today.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.580
What's all the shouting about?

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.240
Qing Yan, don't run!

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.560
- Don't run!
- Why would I?

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.159
I didn't take a loan.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.280
Will you use your head for once?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.560
Your mother is waiting
in the hall to question you.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.320
What's going on?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.319
I've only rested a few days,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.640
and you've made a mess of things.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:10.040
Well? How much do you owe?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.519
A total of 137 taels.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.879
It's only a little over a hundred taels.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.079
No need to make such a fuss.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.560
It's 137 taels of gold.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.640
Gold?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.879
You were blinded by greed.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.079
How dare you take a loan
behind my back!

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.680
Mother, I was wrong.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.680
But Uncle was so stingy,

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.280
I had to raise money myself.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.319
It was all Qing Yan!

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.319
She tricked me into

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.640
putting all my money in.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.280
What does this have to do with me?

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.920
When did I ever tell you to invest?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.159
It was Nan Jiang!

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.359
Nan Jiang told me.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.560
Why would she tell you
about such a good deal?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.480
I don't believe it.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.519
So you beat Nan Jiang first,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.560
then when the investment failed,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.079
you tried to pin it on me?

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.280
Sister!

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.680
Sister!

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.860
A lot of officials just arrived outside.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.719
They say your husband colluded
with brokers to forge records.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.319
They are here to arrest him, Sister!

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.240
Do you people even know who I am?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.919
Officers!

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.280
Surely this must be a mistake?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.719
Sir!

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.520
A mistake? None at all.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.360
Zhang Yuanxing is charged
with buying his title,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.719
corrupting the examination system.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.280
The Prefect has ordered
a full investigation and arrest.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.400
I'm an official of the court!

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.599
I'm the Minister of Revenue!

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.990
Take him.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.639
And what if you are?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.759
Whether a Vice Minister,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.680
or even the Chancellor,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.479
if he breaks the law,
he answers for it.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.240
You vile woman!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.240
I'll report you to the court!

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.680
Report me? For what exactly?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.919
For lying!

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.120
I'll accuse you of deceiving officials.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.719
Do you really think
you're a man of worth

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.479
after pretending to be one?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.720
That post of yours
was bought with silver.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.520
Some "authority" you have.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.879
You're a filth from a den of vice!

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.240
I'll kill you!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.439
Who was it?

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.479
Who dares touch me?

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.039
I am an official of the court!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.919
So,

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.680
you've conspired with her to slander me.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.039
Where is your proof?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.919
No evidence?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.719
Yet, you had
an imperial officer arrested.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.599
When the King of Xiling hears of this,

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.080
your heads will roll!

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.039
I can testify.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.340
(Xiao Lian)

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.400
Miss!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.319
Miss!

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.199
Miss!

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.039
Look at me!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.000
It's me, Xiao Lian!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.719
Miss!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.919
Miss!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.639
Xiao Ye is nothing
but a worthless filth!

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.840
Miss, you have no idea

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.319
how much I went through

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.639
in order to find you.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.879
You must not...

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.479
If you ask me, this pleasure house

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.960
really is a wondrous place.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.039
It brought such a beauty

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.319
into this world.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.199
Now that you're here,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.960
you're never leaving.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.639
Later,

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.600
Xiao Ye used his uncle's connections

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.120
to have me sold off to the frontier.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.920
If not for the General's timely rescue,

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:23.000
I might have

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.079
died in a foreign land.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:29.480
But Miss, your face...

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:35.600
Then,

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.720
I'll take my leave and give you

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.879
some privacy.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:42.720
General.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.639
The young lady is heartbroken now.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.120
You should comfort her.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.560
You knew?

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:01.360
You knew I'm Su Hua?

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.759
That I was searching for Xiao Lian?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.399
Hua…

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.120
You've suffered.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.720
When did you find out?

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:14.920
Why didn't you expose me?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.480
You must have had

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.519
your reasons for all this.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.319
I can't make your choices for you.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.120
I only want to stay by your side,

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.879
to keep you safe.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.959
But when two people are together,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.439
they should make each other better.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.480
I've already fallen into hell.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.279
The two of us...

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.319
Perhaps we were never meant to be.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.160
You haven't fallen into hell.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.879
The ones who belong there

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.519
were never you.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.639
You were only splashed with mire.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.800
Wipe it clean,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.720
and you're still yourself.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.959
But I can't wipe it away.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:13.800
Even now,

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.240
my heart is full of hatred and anger.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.639
It's alright if you can't wipe it away.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.360
Whether you want revenge

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.959
on those who wronged you,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360
whether you are Su Hua or Qing Yan,

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.959
you are

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.720
always the same to me.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.480
Do you want to see

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.160
what lies beneath my mask?

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.839
What I want to see

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.480
isn't whether you're fair or scarred.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.720
I want to know what you've endured.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.959
I want to share your burden.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.360
You're not afraid?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.959
No.

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.079
The truth is,

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.639
most of the time,

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:43.879
I don't face it myself.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.279
Back at Mochun Brothel,

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.439
I always asked Nan Jiang

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.480
to paint patterns for me.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.439
After marrying into your family,

00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:59.480
I grew careless.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:26.879
It's all right.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.040
Even if you don't look, it's fine.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:34.919
Sometimes,

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.320
I wish I could

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.000
face the person I am today.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.279
Hua…

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.879
Don't worry.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.039
I'll make them pay, blood for blood.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.799
Sister, have mercy!

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.639
Please save my husband!

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:38.320
Sister!

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.159
Sister, please save him!

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.080
Sister-in-law…

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.120
How do you expect me to help?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.639
It was you and your husband
who sought to buy a title.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.399
Now, the scheme's exposed.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.159
You must face the consequences.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.559
Madam Xiao,

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:57.120
why quarrel with her in public

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.360
and make yourself a laughingstock?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.639
This is all your fault!

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.679
Master Zhang brought this on himself.

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:07.200
Don't pin the blame on me.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.679
You...

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:08.399
Enough.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.240
At least you aren't in prison.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.480
So, keep your voice down.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.190
Don't bring more trouble on yourself.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.120
Lower your voice.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.559
You've embarrassed yourself.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:20.159
Sister, if you'd spend some
money to smooth things over...

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.919
Don't you know how little I have?

00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:23.360
What do you expect me to do?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:26.159
If you hadn't insisted
on buying that incense

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.639
fit only for funerals,

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.240
my husband wouldn't be in this mess.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.519
You can eat your fill of nonsense,
but don't speak it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.360
When I lent you money,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.200
how you spent it on
buying titles or otherwise

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.759
was never in my control.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.480
And now you come snapping at me?

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:42.720
Sister!

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.559
Madam Xiao.

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:44.799
I think it's time

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.759
this spectacle of hers ended.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.519
I can't live like this!

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.759
You know full well
you're just a woman in this house.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:52.799
I'd like to see

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:54.080
how far you get

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.360
without my support.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.679
Guards!

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.260
Madam Zhang has lost her mind.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:10:59.440
Drag her out of here.

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.279
From this day on, this woman

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.759
who bought official titles

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.759
must never enter again!

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.120
Sister!

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.159
Mother, what is Xiao Yun playing at?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.519
He brought Xiao Lian back.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:22.919
Does he wish to doom us?

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:25.600
He and his wife have never

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:27.919
shown us a shred of mercy.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.679
We might as well finish it.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.440
We should get rid of them.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.039
But with a scandal in the family now,

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.759
so many eyes are watching.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.519
We'd better not stir up more trouble.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.159
Wait and watch the moment.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.840
Act when the time is right.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.639
Hua…

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.720
With me,

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.720
you don't need to hide yourself.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:07.799
Do you know

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:10.639
that before Lady Li died,

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.480
illness had withered her face.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.560
She feared ruining the image she held
in Emperor Wu's heart,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.360
so she refused to see him again.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.960
But you're not like her.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.440
Lady Li was

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.879
but one of many consorts.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.120
You are the only woman I love.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.080
All women in the world

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.240
think the same.

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:36.559
I may still carry
that weight in my heart.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.120
Who doesn't wish to present

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.639
their most perfect self
in the eyes of the one they love?

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:44.559
Hua…

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:47.320
Whatever you wish to do,

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.519
whatever you want of me,

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:53.519
I'll wait with you, stand by you.

00:12:56.679 --> 00:12:58.120
But I ask only one thing.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.519
Can you

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.320
not disappear again?
