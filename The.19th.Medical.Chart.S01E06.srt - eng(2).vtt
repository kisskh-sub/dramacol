00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:08.742
I'm Mizuki Takino, 24 years old,
from Kofu University.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.946
I haven't decided
which department to go to yet.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:17.017
Rather, I don't want to decide now.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.721
I want to see them all for myself
on-site and get to know people.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.594
When I was a child,
there was no hospital in my neighborhood.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.497
I was healthy and didn't need much care.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.799
It was my grandpa…

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.103
It was hard to take
my grandfather to a doctor.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:44.644
That's why I decided to become a doctor
who can be there for people like him.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.082
It is my dream to become
a doctor who can cure anything!

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.619
Saving people's lives.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:57.457
I feel really happy
to have landed a job like that!

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.896
There's nothing more the hospital can do.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.867
My father is a carpenter.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:13.540
He'd always work on site,
and he trained many apprentices.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.177
I'm one of them.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.114
He worked so hard all his life.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.583
And yet…

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:29.222
this is how it's going to end.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:34.227
How would you like him
to spend the time he has left?

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:38.231
You now have
the option of home care for him.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.138
Tatsu Handa, 76 years old.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.474
Stage four, lung cancer.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.478
{\an8}The patient does not wish
to undergo further active treatment

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.380
{\an8}and has requested home care
after consulting his family.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.950
So, will we be making home visits now?

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:01.754
Due to multiple organ metastases,
surgery was off the table from the get-go.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.890
Chemotherapy was also ineffective.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:07.794
Given his age, there is a need
to examine his entire body.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.332
That's why we saw it fitting
to consult with General Medicine.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.002
Excuse me.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.971
Your appointment, Dr. Tokushige.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.439
Sorry, I'll be right there.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.208
- Dr. Takino.
- Yes?

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.811
Can I assign Mr. Handa to you?

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.446
To me?

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.347
Yes.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.416
Of course, I'll examine him with you.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.352
Got it.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.187
Excuse me.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.993
How should I handle
Mr. Handa's prescriptions now?

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:42.996
Takino.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.599
You never did deathwatch
at orthopedics, did you?

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.202
No.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.071
That's why I'm thinking about…

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.575
end-of-life care.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.279
That was quite a climb.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:04.617
Fifteen minutes to the supermarket.
Carrying bags home is like hell.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.053
Quite a lot of old houses here.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.257
About 35% of residents here are elderly,
over the national average.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.260
Mr. Handa's house is up there.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.062
Let's go.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.305
HANDA

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.773
I'll leave it to you now.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.007
Thank you.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.713
Come in.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.847
Excuse us.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.985
The doctors from Uotora are here.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.190
Nice to meet you, Mr. Handa.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.392
I'm Mizuki Takino from General Medicine.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.730
I'll be in your care starting today.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:53.499
You're going to be in his care?

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.802
Sorry, that's not what I meant…

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.438
Oh! It's okay!

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.106
It's fine.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.380
Just lying around makes me feel old.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.386
Dr. Takino was it?

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.587
Yes.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.891
If you need anything, just let me know.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.393
I…

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.632
want to go out with a bang.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.967
With a bang?

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:33.573
Like a movie star.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.376
Doctor,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.411
by all means…

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.715
please help fulfill this wish of mine.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:57.230
GENERAL MEDICINE

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.374
SEEING THE WORLD
THROUGH THE PATIENT'S EYES

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:14.047
The past, the present,
and sometimes the future.

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:18.351
A general physician is to follow
the course of the patient's life.

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.220
The future…

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.528
END-OF-LIFE CARE

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:30.263
Dr. Takino!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.332
- Yes?
- Have you taken your summer leave?

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.833
Oh, no.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.034
Figured.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.969
There's no way we can!

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.639
We'll end up
with a huge backlog of outpatients.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:43.076
I know that,
but our work style is being reformed.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.111
I've taken mine.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.112
What?

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.814
I have the right to.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.450
Splendid! The director will be thrilled.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.387
Sorry for bothering you.
Have you taken your summer leave?

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.722
- Yes, I have.
- Really?

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:56.789
Great.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:57.690
END-OF-LIFE CARE

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.027
Have you taken your summer leave?

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.409
Ms. Takino. How can I help you today?

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.078
It can wait,
please finish what you were doing.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.514
Your brows are furrowing again.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:28.888
Is it about Mr. Handa?

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:30.990
Yes.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.995
What we can do for him…

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.666
is still unclear.

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:47.340
The answer lies in the time
you'll spend together from now on.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.410
From now on?

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:57.517
That's because
we just happen to be on his boat.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.153
By chance.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.862
No way…

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:22.909
Big Bro and Hina are here.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.478
- Go.
- Are you sleeping, Grandpa?

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.014
Wow, you're looking well.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.416
I'm glad you came.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.419
Dad's lost weight, hasn't he?

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:37.990
If he falls ill at midnight,
the ambulance can't get here.

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.961
The Uotora doctors do home visits.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.430
Even doctors can't always come right away.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:49.435
Even Kumi is working full-time now,
so now what?

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:56.008
When will Grandpa get better?

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.481
No idea.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.051
Hello there!

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:10.590
His blood pressure
has gone down, hasn't it?

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:13.459
I might need to fine-tune his medication.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:16.429
I'll share this
with Dr. Kayama at Internal.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.167
Hello.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.806
The window sash replacement!
I'm sorry, I haven't been by…

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.915
May I examine your body, sir?

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.818
Sure.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.621
I'll help you upright. Ready!

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.300
Let me help.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.469
No, I'll do it myself.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.071
Sorry.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.439
It's okay.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.853
You may go ahead.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.091
Excuse me.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.494
Take a deep breath.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.070
Thank you.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.013
You like movies, don't you?

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:46.352
They kill time.

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:52.091
"Okay, cut!"

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:56.629
They have a nice and clear ending.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.569
My grandkids are still little.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.105
Hey, Tatsu!

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.173
Mr. Yokobuki?

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.074
Jun…

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.543
He was around the corner when he called.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.180
I heard you're about to croak.
I thought I'd come to pay my respects!

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.147
Stop that…

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:16.682
That's right.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:21.253
I've got one foot in the grave,
and so do you.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.323
No kidding! I'm not as old as you think.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.192
That goes for every old man!

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.460
I'm sorry, Doctor.

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:28.361
It's fine.

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:32.898
You can count on Dr. Takino.
The famous, modern Red Beard!

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.166
Please, stop that.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:41.207
Tatsu tried to look cool
in front of you, didn't he?

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:42.308
What?

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:46.112
You remind me of Acchan, Dr. Takino.

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:47.013
Acchan?

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:48.514
His wife.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:53.819
He'd clown around with us,
but go all stiff in her presence.

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:57.790
- He sounds like a very lively person.
- No.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.826
He's a carpenter, so he's really strong.

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.829
But you've seen him.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:07.033
His arms are so scrawny now.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.939
Over there, Tatsu built that house!

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:17.143
Hiro lives there, I think?

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:18.577
Over there too!

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:20.513
My bar too…

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:26.886
I was planning to laugh
at him for three more years,

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.988
that show-off.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.533
Are you okay?

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:45.905
Dr. Tenpaku.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.875
Caring for a terminally ill patient?

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:54.180
He's doing fine.
No signs of delirium or such.

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:58.951
Thanks for asking.
I'll consult with you if anything happens.

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.653
Dr. Takino, are you…

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:02.688
What?

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:06.892
Even doctors can book counseling sessions.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.597
I see…

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.666
He does actually talk.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.900
That's not the issue!

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:18.938
Do I look that depressed to you?

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:21.507
Yes, this is my first terminal care stint.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.343
But, I'm just trying to do it right.

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:29.181
"A doctor who can cure anything."

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.816
Right?

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:33.619
Isn't that a cruel thing to say right now?

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:34.987
You think?

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:42.027
When the test results showed
what stage the cancer was at…

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.899
When we found out
that chemo wasn't working…

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:53.172
And when the family told us
the hospital can no longer do anything…

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.574
It frustrated me.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.312
I'm a doctor after all.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.085
Dr. Takino.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.058
It's a violation of labor laws.

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:16.128
To call out an old man like this.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:20.766
That's because you, my senior,
can't commission web tools!

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.403
I get it, I'm sorry!

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.538
Sign here.

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:31.277
You won't go see him?

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.078
What?

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.513
Tokushige.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.685
I'm fine as long as he is doing well.

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.321
Is that so?

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:47.560
Can I come in?

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:51.964
Excuse me, sir.

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.333
Dr. Akaike!

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:01.040
End-of-life care…

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.312
Like a movie star,
he said he wanted to go out with a bang.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.014
That's a tricky one.

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:14.553
As lung cancer progresses,
the phlegm gets tainted by blood,

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.722
there'll be chest pain…

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.625
shortness of breath…

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:21.694
and fever.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:24.897
Need the toilet?

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.066
Just tell me.

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:31.403
Even the simplest routines
will require assistance.

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.306
As the end draws near…

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:38.210
they'll make a strange clattering noise,

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:41.747
one that you don't usually hear
coming from a person.

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.315
That's enough!

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.054
That's what it is to die.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:51.523
Get out of here.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:54.693
Don't discuss my pal like that here.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:06.839
I understand.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.442
You do?

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:13.545
Therefore…

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.348
it's hard.

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.186
Up until now,

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.956
I'd always been…

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.994
praying for my patients' future.

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:31.730
But…

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.336
Sorry, I ended up talking about work.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:41.740
Everyone…

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.878
will die someday.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.251
Going by what you said, Dr. Takino,

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.086
doctors…

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.924
can't save anyone.

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:05.965
Do terminally ill patients…

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.437
really have no future?

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:17.009
No matter how little time they have,

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:22.348
their life goes on
until the very last moment.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:29.054
And, we'll be there with them.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.933
I have to go up.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:48.273
- Doctor, what happened to your knee?
- Yes?

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.744
Oh, I fell down.

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.278
What?

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.582
I was in a hurry to see you.

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:04.456
Mr. Yokobuki told me
that I looked like your wife.

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:09.428
My wife was more put-together…

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:12.865
I'm sorry.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.503
So, which is your favorite movie?

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:21.273
The one at the very top.

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.675
This one?

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:24.676
Yes.

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:25.577
CHIVALROUS WANDERER

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:32.384
The actor here…

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.755
Don't I look like him?

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.390
Well…

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:40.526
you're right.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.763
Doctor, you're bad at flattery.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.964
I'm sorry.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:52.971
This star got a good ending.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:55.474
"Bang!",

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.444
hit by a bullet.

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:05.651
He slowly closes his eyes
in the arms of his sworn brother.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:07.753
"Bang!"

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:11.757
That was kind of cool.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:18.931
But all I can shoot
are painkiller injections.

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:21.900
Nice one!

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:31.376
So, if you're in pain,
please don't hesitate to tell me.

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:35.147
That's what I'm here for.

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:43.222
I know I don't have much time left.

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:49.528
My body is my livelihood, after all.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.465
I can tell.

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:57.903
The houses you built,

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.541
I heard they're everywhere around here,
so I went to see them.

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:06.678
They're all worn out, right?

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:11.717
No, they're all fine and sturdy.
You know Hiro's place?

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:13.986
I love it. The color is cute too!

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:22.995
Doctor.

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.997
Yes?

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:35.374
Your workplace. Is it a workshop?

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.609
It's a studio.

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.578
A studio…

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:43.549
What?

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:47.386
Wow! Did you make all these?

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.758
This is your favorite, Hiro's house.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.693
You're right!

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:58.397
Wow! Oh, it's Mr. Yokobuki's bar!

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:02.034
It's the most worn-out one.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.070
Got to take good care of it.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.977
Little by little…

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.881
Ideas come to me.

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:21.486
"I'd like to do it more like this."
"I should have done it this way."

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:24.189
You keep tweaking them?

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:29.728
Here, the ground is soft.

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:33.098
So, I had to…

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:36.401
drive the stakes deep inside.

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.805
The pillars' positions too.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:44.443
I wanted the wind
to blow through from the south,

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:48.547
so I had them shifted little by little.

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:52.184
So the wind could blow through.

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:55.120
With a mallet…

00:20:57.022 --> 00:21:00.425
hitting the pillars is like music.

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:03.161
Knock…

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.098
Knock…

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:08.934
Knock…

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:12.037
Knock…

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.540
One, two!

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.143
One, two!

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.779
- How is it?
- Just a bit more!

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:21.913
All right.

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:23.782
One, two!

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.084
Okay.

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:27.586
Amazing.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:31.423
What?

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:37.562
You are all over this town.

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:41.333
It's no big deal.

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:48.473
But I've made many memories
having lived here for so long.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:54.346
This shop is where my wife and I

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.882
used to eat parfaits.

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:58.050
Parfaits?

00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:58.984
Yes.

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:02.487
Too bad its closed down since.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.458
Where did you meet your wife?

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.362
At a disco.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.230
A disco?

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:15.167
Those dazzling…

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.437
sparkling lights…

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:20.939
So, it's there…

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:23.709
where you met.

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:40.625
As if I were in a movie.

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:46.998
That's cool.

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:51.036
Mr. Handa, that's so cool.

00:22:54.005 --> 00:22:56.274
Just call me Tatsu.

00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:00.445
Now that I've shown you this…

00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:05.684
you and I are now buddies.

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.356
Tatsu.

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:13.358
You're so cool!

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:32.677
RED BEARD'S CLINIC - SHUGORO YAMAMOTO

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:50.962
Oxygen saturation at 94.
Blood pressure at 84/52.

00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:53.899
37.8 degrees Celsius.

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.101
His fever has gone down.

00:23:56.168 --> 00:24:00.272
His phlegm did catch blood,
but I've never seen it so red.

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:03.341
We gave him an anti-inflammatory drug.

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:05.410
I think it'll do him some good.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.414
Dad!

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:11.450
He's bouncing back.

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:20.859
The sudden fever may be a sign
that his cancer is progressing.

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:26.932
It's very likely
that it will happen again.

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:32.170
So, how many times will this happen again?

00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:34.339
I can't…

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:36.374
- How long will this last?
- Stop it.

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:39.711
I happened to be on a business trip,
so I made it over.

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:42.080
But I can't just rush back from Aichi.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:46.218
If I could at least know
how much longer he has…

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:47.919
That's enough!

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.455
Dad is fighting so hard…

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:55.193
and you dare to ask when he'll die!

00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:58.196
I know that!

00:24:58.897 --> 00:24:59.931
Both of you.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.734
Please have a seat.

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:16.615
I understand how you feel.

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:23.221
I believe that each of you
have your own concerns.

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:25.991
But…

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:29.794
so does your father.

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:02.861
It's okay.

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.498
It's okay, Dad.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.170
It's okay.

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.608
{\an8}I'd like to resume treatment.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:21.413
Are you considering
bringing him back to the hospital?

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:24.783
His coughing has gotten

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:28.253
progressively worse.

00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:31.823
He's got phlegm stuck inside.

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:34.693
He's suffering.

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:41.032
If you're asking for another round
of chemo, given how frail his body is,

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:42.934
I wouldn't recommend it.

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.236
I'm sorry.

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:48.640
I understand that, logically.

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:54.245
But, when push comes to shove…

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.248
I freak out.

00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:02.153
Same thing with my mom.

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:08.493
I didn't make it there in time
when she died.

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:14.366
So, I understand how my brother feels.

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:19.204
Maybe…

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:26.678
I'm just trying to take out my frustration
from that day on my dad.

00:27:28.013 --> 00:27:29.781
That's not true.

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:35.153
I only visit once a week.

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:40.458
But, your family
has to live with this every day.

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:46.331
No matter how much you cherish someone,

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:50.135
it's natural to feel
overwhelmed sometimes.

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.958
I acted lame today.

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:21.666
A bunch of doctors,
much younger than me, comforted me.

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:26.604
I'm so…

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:29.908
uncool, aren't I?

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.458
I'm sorry.

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.897
I'm sorry.

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:07.712
Did you have a nightmare?

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:18.857
I'm…

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:23.027
right here with you.

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.400
Dad…

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.381
Excuse me.

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:47.886
Can we get Tatsu slightly stronger
topical medication?

00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:50.455
I asked Internal about it.

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.792
Apparently, it hurts
when he tries to roll over.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:56.227
It might ease his breathing…

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:03.268
Even just a little,
I want to do everything I can!

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:09.607
Dr. Takino.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:10.675
Yes?

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:14.979
It's tough, right?

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:31.729
Tatsu shared a lot of stories with me.

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:37.202
About the houses he built, and his wife…

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:42.273
They all shone so brightly.

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:45.677
It was like…

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:51.249
I also stepped into that world.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.555
This is how…

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:01.059
I've always wanted…

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.330
to talk to patients.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.105
It's tough.

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:19.377
I know I shouldn't say that, but…

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.915
It's sad.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.424
I want to heal.

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:38.763
That's why…

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:43.468
I became a doctor!

00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:01.286
We're all on a voyage.

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.689
Across a vast ocean.

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:13.264
Like it or not, the ship sails on.

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.533
But…

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:19.070
to join our patients…

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:27.111
in looking ahead to their destination
and propel the ship at full speed…

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.381
that we can do.

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:35.520
Giving them a better journey.

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:38.623
Until the very end.

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:49.934
Since you happen
to be on board the same ship.

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.646
Make the best of it.

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.323
I will.

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:26.204
Don't be too surprised.

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.542
Tatsu!

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.477
Grandpa!

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:33.911
- Tatsu!
- Master!

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:34.912
- Tatsu!
- Master!

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:37.582
What master? So high and mighty.

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.553
Tatsu.

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:47.558
The doctor suggested
having a dinner party.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:55.633
I wanted to meet them,
the people you told me about.

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:58.102
Doc…

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:03.107
You're getting better at flattery.

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:05.510
I mean it!

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:07.378
We're buddies after all.

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.914
Tatsu, you doing well?

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.783
Tatsu, it's been a while!

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:13.051
Long time no see!

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.219
You look good.

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:23.294
This guys screwed up the list.

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.596
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:32.437
He's cool, isn't he?

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.239
Yes.

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.077
Isn't that a bit loud?

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:41.779
This is a disco, is it not?

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:44.248
Sorry, they only had a small one.

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:45.883
Why a disco?

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.086
To commemorate the time he met his wife.

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:51.222
What a liar. It was during a folk dance!
Such a show-off.

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.123
That's not…

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:56.527
It's more or less the same, right?

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:58.896
Not even the slightest!

00:34:58.963 --> 00:34:59.797
Guys!

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:46.444
I wonder why…

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:50.314
Even in all this fun…

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.619
I can't help but cry.

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.384
Hello.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.020
You're in my favorite spot.

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:32.657
I'm sorry. It's closer than my home.

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:41.365
Botox. You can do without it now.

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:49.507
RYUJI HANDA

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:11.762
If you have anyone

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:16.367
who you'd like to see him off,
please contact them.

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:24.408
Can he still hear me?

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.511
Until the very end.

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:31.215
Your voice is surely reaching him.

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.254
Father.

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.323
Wake up.

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:42.760
Father…

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.831
His breathing is labored.

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:48.332
His vitals are sliding.

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.235
Understood.

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:56.340
I'll give the family time
to say their goodbyes.

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:11.789
They said it's time.

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:13.924
Really?

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.496
Even if I leave now…

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:21.666
Yeah, probably.

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:26.437
I'm sorry you had to take care of it all.

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:30.675
It's fine. I know it was hard for you too.

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:32.677
You know what?

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:35.246
It's funny.

00:38:36.013 --> 00:38:37.915
At a time like this…

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:42.653
I was just about to have some cup ramen.

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:46.657
Really, of all times.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.627
That's how it is.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.530
Really?

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.199
Is that so?

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.205
Is Ryuichiro coming?

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.606
He's on the phone.

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.912
RYUICHIRO

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:08.813
Dad.

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:11.115
He wants to see you too.

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.250
Dad?

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.720
Can you hear me?

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.422
It's me, Ryuichiro!

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.058
Talk to your Grandpa.

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.693
No.

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.462
Kotaro…

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:25.763
No!

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:30.801
Is Grandpa going to die?

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:34.472
I'm scared.

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.507
I'm scared, Grandpa!

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.024
I'll go in now.

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:59.363
Excuse me.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.118
There is no sign
of a heartbeat or respiration.

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:57.221
His pupils show no response to light.

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:07.064
Therefore, now at 11:13 a.m.,

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:13.637
I hereby confirm
that the patient has passed away.

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:33.324
Papa, are you crying?

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:41.232
Why? Why are you crying, Papa?

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:49.340
Doctor.

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.847
Thank you.

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.349
My pleasure.

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.207
It was a pleasure serving you.

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.435
Thank you very much.

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:17.027
{\an8}You did a great job.

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:24.468
{\an8}The ship has been sent off.

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:28.839
{\an8}But…

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.276
{\an8}Tatsu is still here.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.946
{\an8}All over this town.

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.089
{\an8}And inside me.

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:49.893
{\an8}Yeah.

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:12.616
{\an8}Dr. Akaike left?

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:14.351
{\an8}Yes, a long time ago.

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.787
{\an8}Dr. Akaike was here?

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.456
{\an8}You didn't get to see him?

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:21.392
{\an8}No, he didn't tell me.

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:26.030
{\an8}But it's him, so I'm not surprised.

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.536
{\an8}Dr. Tokushige?

00:44:34.104 --> 00:44:35.072
{\an8}Look.

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:39.476
{\an8}There's nothing written
on the "End-of-Life Care" page.

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:42.846
{\an8}I was hesitant to ask him about it.

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:49.286
{\an8}END-OF-LIFE CARE

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.422
{\an8}Dr. Tokushige?

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.199
I don't know why.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.936
{\an8}BRAIN FUNCTION MAPPING
CLINICAL NEUROLOGY

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:37.434
I took my summer vacation.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.511
Welcome back, Young Doctor.

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:48.846
It's been a long time.

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:50.647
Dr. Takino must be lonely.

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:53.283
- Are you okay on your own?
- I'm not so sure.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.086
Why is Dr. Takino in our Surgical meeting?

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:59.189
You are not alone, that's my opinion.

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.091
You can't save lives with only ideals.

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:03.227
Sometimes, patients lie.

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:05.896
You're the one who taught me that.

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:06.797
{\an8}Leave!

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.133
{\an8}I won't tell you!

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.134
