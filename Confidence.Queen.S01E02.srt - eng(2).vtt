00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.776
Hi. My young master bastard.

00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:21.081
Hey, film this.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.460
Our young master.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.379
Are you happy?

00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.466
-You are stupid.
-Yeah?

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.301
-You want to die?
-Die?

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.597
Wake up, young master.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.725
-Hey.
-Hey. Let go.

00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:44.814
I was a boxer. Bring it on.

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:45.898
Bring it on.

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:52.613
Happy?

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:11.799
I don't care whether you spend this money
on gambling or on drugs.

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.551
What I care about is

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:18.097
how you brought this money
into this country without any trouble.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.808
This is my first time.
You have to trust me.

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:23.143
Are you trying
to slip out of this by yourself?

00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:25.437
I'm doing this because I'm a newbie.

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:26.564
-I never--
-Sir.

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.566
I need you to take a look at this.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.943
Here's the video
of Rising Airlines' love child.

00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:33.737
Me? What about me? What?

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.032
RISING AIRLINES' LOVE CHILD

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:41.954
Check his left shoulder.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.592
A gun?

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.316
Who are you?

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:15.446
Hey, show me the video.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.202
If you're going to scam me,
at least do it right.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:30.920
What?

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:34.340
It's on the other side! I swear!

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:37.009
That's a mirror reflection!

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.141
For Christ's sake! I told you.
It's on the right shoulder.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:57.529
Jeez, a gun?

00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.492
EPISODE 2

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.244
Just sit tight and answer my calls.

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.748
I could have you locked up
for smuggling cash, overseas gambling,

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.666
and even drugs.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.461
Would you rather be locked up
in the Philippines or Korea?

00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:19.551
See you in Seoul.

00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:21.136
Yes, sir.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.685
Okay! He took the bait.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.853
Jeon Tae-su's not easy as they said.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:32.272
I swear I almost peed my pants.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.817
If you'd listened to me
and just played the pilot,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.235
that all could've been avoided.

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:37.152
-Right?
-What?

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.197
Good job.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.158
Yi-rang, why did you take that?

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:45.077
That's a stimulant!

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.495
Spit it out!

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.122
Spit it out already!

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:49.915
Spit it out, Yi-rang!

00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:55.671
Yi-rang!

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.384
Come on.
I'm not stupid enough to take that.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.720
Seriously, you always crack me up.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.097
-Jeez!
-Let's go.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.265
Just get in the car.

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.475
-You're making the pain worse.
-Good job. Now, lean on me.

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.937
Check when he was in the Philippines
and his alibi at the casino and the club.

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:12.855
Yes, sir.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:22.406
It's me.
I need you to look into something.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.118
Closely mark him to see
if he's the love child of Rising Airlines.

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.620
If anything suspicious comes up,
report it immediately.

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:30.289
Yes, sir.

00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:49.308
We're home.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.642
Nangrang, be careful.

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:52.728
Come on, Jeje. One, two.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.521
Jeje, be careful. Slow down.

00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:57.066
Oh, my babies. You're home.

00:05:58.442 --> 00:05:59.902
Goodness.

00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:03.072
It's Mommy and Daddy.

00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:06.658
Say you're home.

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.079
My babies refuse to go outside

00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:13.540
without you, Mr. Myung.

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:16.668
No need to call me Mr. Myung.

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.213
If you need me to walk them,
just give me a call.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.255
Here.

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:21.548
Thank you for your work.

00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:22.758
Thank you.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.843
Oh, hold on.

00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:26.053
Thank you so much.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:28.222
Oh wow. Goodness. Thank you.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:29.807
-No problem.
-Thanks for your work.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.266
Goodbye.

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:52.412
It's a pleasure to see you here in Seoul.

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.208
Let's cut to the chase. Bring the package.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.460
SAND FOUNDATION

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:01.922
Take it to the Philippines

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.800
and hand it off to our guy
in the agreed spot.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.761
May I ask what's inside that…

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.265
Sorry.

00:07:12.683 --> 00:07:15.060
What do you think
matters the most in life?

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:17.479
Well, obviously, that's mon--

00:07:17.563 --> 00:07:19.231
-It's trust.
-Trust.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:22.484
Since I'm trusting you with the job,
there are rules you need to follow.

00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:24.862
Don't open the package
under any circumstances.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.738
And no matter what happens,

00:07:26.822 --> 00:07:28.907
do not mention my name.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.535
If you break these rules…

00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:33.370
If we do…

00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:39.835
Use your imagination.
What do you think would happen?

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:48.552
Are you sure we'll be okay?

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.888
We do have a plan in place, don't we?

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.557
Please tell me that we do.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.600
Not telling you.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.352
What? How can you be joking…

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.898
Hey!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.484
If I ask you a question,
I expect an answer.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.823
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:11.074
I'm sure you won't die.

00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:14.953
So typical.
You always have everything your way.

00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:17.664
Maybe you should try
using your brain like me.

00:08:17.748 --> 00:08:20.334
How dare you stare at me
with those round eyes?

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.003
Do you want me to make them square?
Or perhaps a triangle shape?

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.797
See! There it is! You keep talking back!

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:28.884
Do you really want to see me
lose my temper?

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:32.387
Having fun?

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.265
Enjoy it while you can.

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:38.810
It's just an act. Let's go.

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.391
Come on. It's a great deal.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:20.936
-Is it 300 per night?
-It's 800…

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.354
Please give us a discount.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:23.355
What are you staring at?

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.275
Just thinking about the old days.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.777
Back at Sunyuldo Island,
where we first met.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.112
-Make it 700.
-It's 800.

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.113
The place is near.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.115
-We don't have that much.
-Make it 700.

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:38.996
WELCOME
GU-HO'S INN

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.747
Did you make a reservation for tonight?

00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:41.748
Yes, that's right.

00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:42.916
I see. Hello.

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.269
So what do you say?

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.146
-Where is it anyway?
-Just around there.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.523
Right. It does feel familiar.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.527
Peaceful, simple, and quiet.

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:13.280
You used to be just like him.

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.116
Yeah, I was just like him.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.704
Although things have changed a lot,

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.874
maybe we can go back one day.

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.586
Are you sleeping?

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:32.049
You're the one
who started this conversation.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:08.585
What the heck?

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.519
Is he still knocked out?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.650
I told you to go easy on the gas.
We don't have much time.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:32.901
I'm sorry.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.153
Where's the girl? Let's check on her.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.206
What the heck?

00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:36.006
Damn.

00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:53.398
Jeez! You scared me! Who are you?

00:12:53.482 --> 00:12:55.901
Who do you think?
I'm the one who kidnapped you.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:57.527
Kidnap?

00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.571
-You know Jeon Tae-su, right?
-Yes.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:00.489
I mean, no.

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:04.576
I used to work with him back in the day,
but there was a small misunderstanding.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:09.372
So unfortunately,
he had my internal organs rearranged.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:13.251
See, I'm not the kind of guy
who can sleep at night when I owe others.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.669
So I plan to pay him back.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.549
Is this your bag?

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:25.514
That man is still up to his old tricks.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.767
If you had shown up at the drop point
with this package,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.063
you would've been picked up by the police
and thrown into some filthy cell for days.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:37.359
That's what he does to test your loyalty.
To see if you'll rat him out or not.

00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:40.779
I don't know why that's in my bag.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:44.783
I have nothing to do with any of this.
You have to believe me.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:45.992
Look, lady.

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.994
Drop the lousy act.

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:51.915
I'm taking this
to the Narcotics Division in Korea,

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.793
and I'm going to need you to testify.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.808
I have to get out of here.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.227
Yi-rang, hang in there.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.689
I'll go and get the cops myself.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:17.941
Those scumbags.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.094
Look at that.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.561
How are you guys doing?

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.688
Don't come this way.

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:59.065
-No! Stop!
-What's this idiot doing?

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.070
-Wait. Stay!
-You can't get out of here.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.867
Gu-ho.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.035
Oh, I know. I get it.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.995
Chairman Jeon told you
to keep your mouth shut.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.580
But guess what?

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:16.583
You know what happens
when you fail to carry out his order?

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:23.381
Is that so?

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.315
Oh, fuck. I…

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.108
Horrible, right?

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.903
The young man you came with
tried something cute.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.697
Awful, right?

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.826
Even if you two make it out of here,
the chairman's still going to kill you.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.079
So? Feeling a bit more cooperative now?

00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:58.249
Or do you want your friend
to wear mittens for the rest of his life?

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.929
Please have mercy.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.181
-What?
-Not on me…

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.560
but my friend.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.439
Make it his ring finger
instead of his middle finger.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:24.901
At the very least,
allow him to make a living.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:27.404
Please, I beg you.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.837
The lady next door asked me

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.381
to chop your ring finger off
instead of your middle finger.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.050
Why?

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.593
I'm only going to take your pinky.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.138
You'll lose your wrist if you move.
Stay still.

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.349
Clench your teeth.
It's going to hurt a bit.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:09.654
What was that?

00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.656
I told you not to move.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.699
Stay still.

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:15.160
I'll cut her finger instead.

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.619
No, wait!

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.163
Hold on.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.540
Wait. I'll do it.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:22.876
Keep your finger straight.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.503
Put it here. I'll just cut up to here.

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:26.671
That's all I'll take.

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:27.881
Stay still.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.202
What now?

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:00.789
Good job.

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:23.895
My finger.

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:25.688
I still have it.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.065
It's still there.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:30.443
Are you okay?

00:18:31.402 --> 00:18:32.779
Chairman Jeon?

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.413
Chairman Jeon.

00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:04.936
You're really in the mood
for this right now?

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:07.605
Do you have any idea what I went through?

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.859
And you asked him to take my ring finger?
Are you kidding me?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:16.865
Gu-ho, why do you always see
just one side of things?

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:18.658
I do see more than one side of things.

00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:20.618
The man who kidnapped us.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:24.664
He said it with his own mouth
that he had gone through the same thing.

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:27.250
But he had all five fingers on his hand.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.295
He was just bluffing
about chopping fingers off.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.171
It's all a set-up.

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.717
I bet you
Jeon Tae-su heard every word we said.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:39.345
That man is still up to his old tricks.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.436
Anyway, thanks to
your heartfelt performance today,

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.272
I'm pretty sure
Jeon Tae-su's fully convinced now.

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.399
Lucky day for us.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.235
I'm being completely serious right now.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.112
I think Jeon Tae-su is

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.740
way more caring than you are.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.911
For one, he hugged me. Okay?

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.787
He comforted me. Right?

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:05.705
What else?

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.123
-Gu-ho.
-What?

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.042
Have you forgotten about James?

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:13.004
Are you a piece of trash?

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.343
Jeon Tae-su, that scum of the earth.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:19.677
That's right.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.854
When is Jeon Tae-su going to reach us?

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:32.732
That scumbag.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.860
Just wait until he calls me…

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.617
Salute. Thank you, sir.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:54.504
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
FINANCIAL INVESTIGATION

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.218
SAND FOUNDATION FINANCIAL STATEMENT
NOTICE OF TAX AUDIT COMMENCEMENT

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.971
THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU
THAT A TAX AUDIT WILL BE CONDUCTED

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.560
This much evidence could lead
to a search warrant within a month.

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.771
I need to push the timeline forward.

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:13.523
I will keep that in mind.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.859
What do you want me to do about the two?
Should I keep digging?

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:28.037
No, there's no need for that.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.294
How much is all this?

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:37.672
It's 50 billion won.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.634
Fifty billion won?

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.308
Everything needs to be moved to
my summer house in Manila by next Friday.

00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:53.479
The amount is much larger
than we expected,

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:55.606
so our current methods won't--

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.358
Are you saying no?

00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:00.153
Sir, with that amount,

00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:03.448
isn't it better to open
a shell company in the Bahamas

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.199
and send it to that location?

00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.578
You think I didn't look into that?

00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.954
I'm sure you did, sir.

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:13.958
Stop spinning that worthless brain
of yours and find a way.

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:15.918
That's why I kept you alive.

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:22.175
Well, there is one way.

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.927
Good. And that is?

00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:27.805
To reduce the time it takes to board
during vacation season,

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:30.141
they opened a new lane
that allows passengers

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.643
to skip taking out their laptops
from their luggage.

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:34.979
We can fool the X-ray

00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:37.899
by placing a shielding device
in our luggage.

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:47.241
This device will absorb radiation
and block X-rays,

00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:49.535
which will allow it
to slip through security.

00:23:10.098 --> 00:23:11.307
All right.

00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:13.017
Shall we get started?

00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:16.187
Yes.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.676
Gosh. What's wrong with this dog?

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:49.804
Go away.

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:53.349
Hey, get away from me. Come on.

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:54.684
-What--
-You need to come with us.

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:55.935
Where are you taking me?

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:58.813
Let go! Don't touch me!

00:23:58.896 --> 00:23:59.856
Stay still.

00:24:02.817 --> 00:24:03.901
I'm sorry.

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.778
What happened?

00:24:05.862 --> 00:24:07.947
Why was that dog all over that bag?

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.367
Due to recent issues with cash smuggling,

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.036
a cash-sniffing dog was deployed
as of yesterday.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.831
I should've informed you
about this in advance. I'm sorry.

00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:20.626
What are you going to do about the money?

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.921
Do you know how much was in there?
That was one billion won!

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.257
The love child is back.

00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:27.675
Bring him to me.

00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:32.930
Hey. Ouch. Hold on.

00:24:34.223 --> 00:24:35.808
-Where's the bag?
-What?

00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:38.686
Well, my father got me out…

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:41.355
I mean, he pulled some strings.

00:24:41.439 --> 00:24:44.150
About the money,
that needs to be investigated…

00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:53.618
If anything happens to my money,

00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:56.329
I'll cut you open and sell
whatever's worth anything

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:58.206
down to the bones.

00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:59.749
-What?
-Take them both.

00:25:06.422 --> 00:25:07.673
Would you like a flyer?

00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:16.057
Darn it.

00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:28.194
Sir, this is it.

00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:35.076
All you need to do
is focus on your responsibilities.

00:25:37.161 --> 00:25:39.247
Are you out of your mind?

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.373
Sir, think about it.

00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:42.041
What does the Sand Foundation do?

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:46.379
Protect children, respond to disasters,
and fight poverty.

00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:49.173
What are you trying to pull here?

00:25:49.257 --> 00:25:50.716
Basically…

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.970
We promote
the Sand Foundation's spirit of giving

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:56.430
on a global scale
through a massive donation campaign.

00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:58.975
Which means we charter a private flight

00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:01.435
to send relief supplies overseas.

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.484
FILL A RELIEF BOX
SPREAD WARMTH ACROSS THE WORLD

00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:11.028
What are you saying?

00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:14.282
We'll fill it with clothes, medicine,
and relief supplies.

00:26:14.365 --> 00:26:16.784
If we split the bags of cash
in those boxes,

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.869
no one will suspect anything?

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.833
Leave the chartered plane to me, sir.

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:26.335
You know, I have my ways, right?

00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:38.514
Ms. Kim.

00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:42.476
That's impressive.

00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:44.687
Good job.

00:26:51.152 --> 00:26:52.153
Jeez.

00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:56.991
What was that for?

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:01.245
My blood sugar's dropping.

00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:04.206
Jeon Tae-su sure is intense, right?

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.126
He said he'd sell whatever's worth
anything down to the bones. Jeez.

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:10.546
You did well out there, Gu-ho.
Eat as much as you want.

00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:25.186
Hey!

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:27.938
This pungent and funky cheese scent.

00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:31.525
There's no way a dog could resist that.

00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:32.860
Your timing was impeccable.

00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:34.737
-Go away. What--
-You need to come with us.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.238
Are you serious?

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.409
Why did you go the hard way
and make things so complicated?

00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:42.787
We could've just chartered a plane
from the start.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.246
Here's the thing.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.082
I had to show Jeon Tae-su that

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:49.543
moving the money using our current method
was not an option.

00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:50.669
For that to happen,

00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:53.756
he had to witness you getting caught.

00:27:54.757 --> 00:27:55.800
That's how it works.

00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:58.886
Once suspicion fades,
it gives way to trust.

00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:01.806
If we had brought up
the chartered plane from the start,

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:04.225
he wouldn't have bought into the idea.

00:28:06.477 --> 00:28:08.813
What? Did you fall for me again?

00:28:08.896 --> 00:28:10.064
Oh, come on.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:13.192
Am I really that pretty? Jeez.

00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:17.488
I have to admit, the shielding device
that bypasses security was quite clever.

00:28:18.155 --> 00:28:19.240
Thanks.

00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:28.416
Seriously, who would've guessed
this was all staged and set up beforehand?

00:28:28.499 --> 00:28:29.834
That's how people are.

00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:32.670
They only believe
what they can see with their own eyes.

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:35.756
They have no clue
how tight aviation security is.

00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:38.092
Gosh, Yi-rang.

00:28:39.343 --> 00:28:42.847
Seriously, how do you always
come up with these kinds of ideas?

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.432
You were born to do this.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.934
It'd be a shame
to let this talent go to waste.

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.018
Jeez.

00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:49.478
Now, Gu-ho.

00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:50.938
What's next?

00:28:57.862 --> 00:29:00.406
I just received word
that he'll be arriving soon.

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:10.958
Long time no see.

00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.376
Excuse me?

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.962
I was supposed to meet you
with the chairman,

00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:17.214
but I've been too busy to reach out.

00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:21.135
So, how exactly do we know…

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:23.721
Don't be a stranger. Come on.

00:29:23.804 --> 00:29:24.638
Card.

00:29:29.018 --> 00:29:31.020
Let's talk upstairs. Come on.

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:34.440
-Okay.
-All right.

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.533
SAND FOUNDATION
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER GO HO-JIN

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:48.496
If things go according to plan,

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:52.041
the Sand Foundation
will fully back the fundings.

00:29:52.875 --> 00:29:55.377
Oh, of course. It's for a good cause.

00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:57.254
Naturally, we'll do everything
to support you.

00:29:57.338 --> 00:29:59.173
If you need anything besides the flight--

00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:00.424
One more thing.

00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:06.889
No one outside of these four walls
must know about our meeting today.

00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:09.725
Don't even tell the chairman about this.

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:15.689
Since we're a charitable foundation,

00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:19.151
there's been quite a lot of talk
about the source of the funds.

00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:24.031
I will keep that in mind, Director Go.

00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:26.325
All right, then. I'll see you around.

00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:27.243
Yes, sir.

00:30:30.496 --> 00:30:31.330
Yes.

00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:34.208
Oh, that's nice.

00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:35.709
Okay. See you.

00:30:35.793 --> 00:30:37.419
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:50.808
Booked a chartered flight
with Jeon Tae-su's money.

00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:10.244
Let's go.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.104
Yes.

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.067
The trucks are entering the premises.

00:31:42.151 --> 00:31:42.985
Yes.

00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:48.073
They've all entered the premises.

00:31:56.874 --> 00:31:59.293
All right. Let's get on the flight.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:02.796
And now, our great journey begins.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.257
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

00:32:10.012 --> 00:32:13.641
-This is almost over.
-I'd like to thank the supporters…

00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:15.643
Anyway, why are the supplies not here yet?

00:32:15.726 --> 00:32:18.103
Just be patient.
Luck is always on my side.

00:32:18.187 --> 00:32:20.230
Can you make a finger heart?

00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:23.150
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:26.904
Thank you. Okay.

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.114
-Sir.
-Yes.

00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:31.200
Take a look at this.

00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:33.369
It's here.

00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:36.163
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:44.046
Wrap things up here.

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.214
Yes, sir.

00:32:46.507 --> 00:32:49.927
We'll wrap up the interview here
due to the flight schedule.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.844
Thank you.

00:32:52.721 --> 00:32:53.639
Sir.

00:32:58.477 --> 00:32:59.353
Let's get on the plane.

00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:00.688
Yes, sir.

00:33:02.815 --> 00:33:06.235
We should enjoy the ending
of our project together.

00:33:20.165 --> 00:33:21.834
Something feels different,
don't you think?

00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:24.545
Don't be distracted
and keep your head in the game.

00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:25.963
But…

00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:46.400
We pulled the money bags
from the cargo hold

00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:47.693
and had them brought up.

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:50.195
Thanks.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.531
I couldn't have done it without you two.

00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:53.657
Thank you, sir.

00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:56.160
We can't take the credit.

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:58.162
You were the one who gave us a chance.

00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:01.874
I'll use the restroom.

00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:02.875
Oh, the restroom.

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:04.543
Thanks.

00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:11.550
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:12.926
Yi-rang.

00:34:14.303 --> 00:34:17.055
I was clear on the plan up until now,
but what do we do moving forward?

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.515
We'll figure it out as we go.

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:20.809
What do you mean?

00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:22.978
What's that supposed to mean?

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:25.689
Oh, the restroom is occupied.

00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:27.191
What? What are you doing?

00:34:34.198 --> 00:34:35.449
What a shame.

00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:37.284
-What?
-It was almost perfect.

00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:39.578
Sir, why are you doing this?

00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:44.124
KOREAN TOURIST MURDERED IN THE PHILIPPINES

00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:46.460
CONFIRMED AS THE LOVE CHILD
OF RISING AIRLINES CHAIRMAN

00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:51.465
How dare you try to steal my money?

00:34:53.509 --> 00:34:56.220
Oh, dear. You poor things.

00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:58.347
How can you be this unlucky?

00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:01.517
Or maybe,

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.268
I'm just that lucky?

00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:05.479
I can explain everything.

00:35:05.562 --> 00:35:07.481
-Sure.
-Wait.

00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:09.483
-Hey, don't move.
-What are you doing?

00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:13.320
That reminds me.
No wonder you looked so familiar.

00:35:14.404 --> 00:35:16.740
But who cares about all of that now?

00:35:16.824 --> 00:35:18.450
It'll all be over soon.

00:35:18.534 --> 00:35:19.368
Please, sir.

00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:20.744
-Don't do this.
-Hey, don't move.

00:35:20.828 --> 00:35:23.664
Once you wake up,
this will all be behind you. Okay?

00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:26.291
Your job and your life too.

00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:27.709
Hold on.

00:35:31.588 --> 00:35:34.132
-What was that?
-What's going on?

00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:37.970
What just happened?

00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:40.681
Sir, are you okay?

00:35:47.437 --> 00:35:48.981
We're experiencing turbulence.

00:35:49.064 --> 00:35:51.358
Please be seated
and fasten your seat belts.

00:35:52.818 --> 00:35:53.819
Darn it.

00:36:04.955 --> 00:36:05.956
What's happening?

00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:07.666
Hey, go to your seats.

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:20.387
What's happening?

00:36:38.906 --> 00:36:39.907
Darn it!

00:36:51.293 --> 00:36:52.210
Hey, wake up.

00:36:52.294 --> 00:36:53.921
Wake up, for goodness' sake!

00:37:07.017 --> 00:37:09.394
Due to engine damage and the risk of fire,

00:37:09.478 --> 00:37:11.730
we are unable to continue
to our destination as we planned.

00:37:11.813 --> 00:37:14.024
We'll attempt an emergency landing
at the nearest airport.

00:37:14.107 --> 00:37:15.692
-Sorry for the inconvenience--
-Shut it!

00:37:23.784 --> 00:37:25.035
No!

00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:36.588
Watch out! Be careful!

00:37:43.387 --> 00:37:44.304
What is that?

00:37:46.765 --> 00:37:47.599
Look.

00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:52.062
Huh?

00:38:09.997 --> 00:38:13.291
In order to ensure a safe landing,
we need to lighten the aircraft.

00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:15.585
We kindly ask for your cooperation.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.504
Lighten the aircraft?

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.341
Hey, flight attendant.

00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:23.552
Hey! What are you doing?

00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:26.430
Sir! This is a dangerous situation,
so be quiet!

00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:29.099
Hey, don't touch mine.
I said don't touch it.

00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:31.768
Hey! I made it clear.

00:38:31.852 --> 00:38:32.686
Hey!

00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:35.355
Hey, man. Be quiet!

00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:37.190
She's only doing what's necessary.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.445
First Officer!

00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:46.450
Altitude loss! Cabin depressurization!

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.035
Yes, sir.

00:38:48.118 --> 00:38:49.077
You…

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:51.496
Oh my. Sir…

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.248
-Don't.
-Let go of me.

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.291
Don't touch my stuff!

00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:56.001
Emergency exit. One, two, three.

00:38:56.543 --> 00:38:58.628
It's too dangerous. You can't do that.

00:38:58.712 --> 00:39:00.964
-Seriously. Don't do it!
-No!

00:39:04.801 --> 00:39:07.012
Let go of me! No! Darn it!

00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:15.395
Release the heavy cargo!

00:39:16.646 --> 00:39:17.481
Release!

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:28.408
Hey!

00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:30.243
What the heck are you doing now?

00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:43.465
End of release!

00:39:46.343 --> 00:39:47.761
-Wait…
-No. Sir. Wait.

00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:00.440
You dumped everything?

00:40:01.024 --> 00:40:04.861
Thanks to everyone's cooperation,
we were able to react fast.

00:40:04.945 --> 00:40:05.779
Thank you.

00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:08.073
You…

00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:10.408
Hi. It's dangerous. Get back to your seat.

00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:11.451
Captain Kim.

00:40:12.244 --> 00:40:15.122
You punks. Are you out of your minds?

00:40:16.456 --> 00:40:17.290
-Gu-ho.
-Yes?

00:40:17.958 --> 00:40:18.792
-Gu-ho.
-Yes.

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:19.960
Yi-rang's calling you.

00:40:20.043 --> 00:40:21.002
What?

00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:23.338
Wake up, boy. Get to work.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.927
What's going on?

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.011
Are you out of your mind?

00:40:30.095 --> 00:40:31.555
Let go of me!

00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:35.934
Did you just dump my 50 billion?

00:40:37.686 --> 00:40:39.437
Right! That was money!

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.399
What are you going to do?
I threw it all out.

00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:44.192
What are we going to do?

00:40:58.957 --> 00:40:59.791
Open it.

00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:01.793
What?

00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:03.170
-Grab it.
-Grab it?

00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:05.714
-Okay.
-Put it on.

00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:08.884
Put it on!

00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:12.012
Are you telling me to jump off this plane?

00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.555
-Of course!
-Okay!

00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:15.849
Don't you dare move!

00:41:16.558 --> 00:41:18.226
Or I'm going to kill you both!

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.895
Put this on!

00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:21.897
What? Why do I…

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.023
Hey, you take it.

00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:25.400
Put it on. What are you doing?

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.485
Put it on and go find my money!

00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:37.037
I saved your sorry lives when you were
barely making a living on the streets.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.289
I gave you a shot at a decent life,

00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:41.041
and this is how you repay me?

00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:53.511
What are you going to do?

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:58.099
Are you going to jump off? Just for that?

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.187
"Just for that?"

00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:07.734
You've never had this kind of money,

00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:10.654
so of course you don't get it.

00:42:50.443 --> 00:42:51.736
-Did he jump?
-My gosh!

00:43:06.876 --> 00:43:07.752
Close the door.

00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:09.713
-How do I close it?
-Grab that.

00:43:09.796 --> 00:43:11.631
Grab that.

00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:13.133
You got it.

00:43:13.967 --> 00:43:15.552
You got it! Nice!

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:19.014
One, two, three.

00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.126
There it is.

00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:50.170
There are my babies.

00:43:50.253 --> 00:43:52.255
Oh, my precious babies.

00:44:03.725 --> 00:44:04.726
My babies.

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:06.436
Thank you.

00:44:23.328 --> 00:44:24.162
What is this?

00:44:27.874 --> 00:44:29.459
Darn it!

00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:37.092
The aircraft is now safe.

00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:40.345
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll take you safely to your destination.

00:44:52.107 --> 00:44:53.817
James, while we're buying time outside,

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.236
swap the money bags
that are in the cargo hold.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.949
Do you know how hard it was
to switch all those money bags by myself?

00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:08.873
Good job. Well done.

00:45:08.957 --> 00:45:10.166
Nice acting.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:11.626
Well done.

00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:15.922
Yi-rang, good work. Well done.

00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:18.133
Gu-ho, good job.

00:45:19.843 --> 00:45:20.802
James…

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:21.928
Oh no.

00:45:22.011 --> 00:45:25.223
What is wrong with him?
He's sleeping all day.

00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:27.434
That punk. He's so fragile.

00:45:49.956 --> 00:45:51.458
Ta-da!

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:55.920
Remember how I bought a winery
in Burgundy, France, last month?

00:45:56.004 --> 00:45:56.838
Yes.

00:45:56.921 --> 00:45:59.048
This champagne is from that winery.

00:45:59.132 --> 00:46:01.634
Since I'm the owner,
I should have a taste.

00:46:01.718 --> 00:46:03.219
Of course you should.

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.017
How could you do that to me?

00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:14.189
Sorry. Just come and join us.

00:46:14.272 --> 00:46:15.690
-No.
-Just come here.

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.150
-No.
-Come here!

00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:18.943
I just don't get it.

00:46:19.027 --> 00:46:20.069
Explain it to me.

00:46:20.153 --> 00:46:23.198
How much of it was real
and how much of it was fake?

00:46:25.617 --> 00:46:27.994
It's true that James approached him
disguised as a captain.

00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:31.331
If you don't mind,
can I get your business card too?

00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:34.125
Jeon Tae-su was
way more skeptical than expected.

00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:36.503
It was hard to buy his trust.

00:46:36.586 --> 00:46:39.172
So we realized
it wouldn't work out and withdrew.

00:46:39.506 --> 00:46:41.382
TRUTH

00:46:41.466 --> 00:46:43.426
From then on, it was a lie.

00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:48.014
Jeon Tae-su never showed up
at the cargo ship that day.

00:46:48.515 --> 00:46:52.352
So James getting assaulted and beaten up
was a lie we made up.

00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:53.269
FALSE

00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:57.649
We kept waiting for Jeon Tae-su
to call us after that,

00:46:58.274 --> 00:47:01.361
but because he was so skeptical,
he never even texted us.

00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:05.240
Change of plan.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:08.034
But as soon as we withdrew the operation,

00:47:08.117 --> 00:47:09.911
you came to our minds.

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:13.081
Because what Jeon Tae-su wants
is not trust

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:16.459
but absolute loyalty and obedience.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.503
So that was the plan.

00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:21.881
You really had this all figured out
from the start!

00:47:21.965 --> 00:47:23.633
Gu-ho, pass me the truffle oil over there.

00:47:24.008 --> 00:47:26.386
Could you grind
some Himalayan pink salt for me?

00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:29.222
Seriously, my life is just…

00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:30.515
It's got a great body.

00:47:30.598 --> 00:47:31.432
So refreshing.

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:33.017
Seriously.

00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:37.480
See? Absolute loyalty and obedience.

00:47:37.564 --> 00:47:40.066
That's what you embody.
You were perfect for this job.

00:47:42.402 --> 00:47:44.487
You can't have this. Don't eat it.

00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:47.365
We're saying you're considerate.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:49.909
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:55.039
-Eat.
-Thank you.

00:47:55.582 --> 00:47:58.167
Wait, you were going
to jump off the plane.

00:47:58.251 --> 00:47:59.335
What was that about?

00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:02.714
Yi-rang, I'd always known
that you were crazy, but I never--

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:05.425
At altitudes below 3,000 meters,

00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:08.386
the pressure difference between
the cabin and the outside isn't severe,

00:48:08.469 --> 00:48:10.722
so there's no risk
of sudden decompression.

00:48:12.307 --> 00:48:13.433
FLIGHT ALTITUDE = 1,000 METERS

00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:15.435
So as long as
we didn't climb any higher...

00:48:17.437 --> 00:48:19.314
I had already run the numbers.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.568
Hey, still, that was wrong. You know?

00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:24.777
I'm serious.

00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:27.113
James, it must've been so easy for you.

00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:28.031
What?

00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:30.158
When I was fighting for my life,

00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:34.370
you were just lying on the hospital bed
all comfortable, just killing time.

00:48:34.454 --> 00:48:36.956
What are you talking about?
I was really busy.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.875
I was always by your side.

00:48:39.584 --> 00:48:41.044
What are you talking about?

00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:46.549
This isn't an art piece,
so just take the pictures.

00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:48.009
You're not filming a movie.

00:48:49.594 --> 00:48:50.428
He left.

00:48:51.888 --> 00:48:52.847
-Did he leave?
-Yes.

00:48:58.311 --> 00:48:59.687
Salute. Thank you, sir.

00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:01.606
Okay, bye.

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:15.453
Gosh.

00:49:16.245 --> 00:49:19.666
Why did they have to make it so tight?
I told them this wasn't necessary.

00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:22.794
I don't have time for this.

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:27.298
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR GENERAL

00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:29.092
I can't feel my arm.

00:49:29.926 --> 00:49:30.927
But I'm so busy.

00:49:34.514 --> 00:49:35.723
Oh, be quiet.

00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:47.777
Where are you going?

00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:50.780
I'm so sick of you.

00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:54.575
I've had enough. Don't try to find me!

00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:57.620
I think he's really sick of us this time.
I can feel it.

00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.292
That hurts! Yi-rang. James.

00:50:03.376 --> 00:50:04.210
What's up, Ray-bang?

00:50:04.293 --> 00:50:06.629
Help me. What's he doing?

00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:09.632
You didn't have to bring anything.

00:50:10.258 --> 00:50:11.092
Salute.

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:12.260
Salute.

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:14.595
Hello. Good work, everyone.

00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:15.763
Yes. Good work.

00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:20.810
You were from…

00:50:28.985 --> 00:50:30.653
When did this happen? Huh?

00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:34.532
He's my junior from the Marine Corps.
He happened to be working for Jeon Tae-su.

00:50:34.615 --> 00:50:36.325
So I scouted him immediately.

00:50:36.993 --> 00:50:39.704
Mr. Ray-Bang here brought Mr. Mustache,
who used to work in film,

00:50:39.787 --> 00:50:42.290
and that's how we got our secret agents.

00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:43.791
Okay.

00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:45.209
Well done.

00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:46.878
Here, this is for you,

00:50:47.837 --> 00:50:49.130
and this is for Mr. Mustache.

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:51.924
Thank you, sir.
I will continue to do my best.

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:53.593
Thank you. Have a seat.

00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:56.471
This is yours, Gu-ho.

00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:03.102
What happened to the rest?

00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:05.021
Do you know
how much it costs to charter a plane?

00:51:05.104 --> 00:51:06.647
We also had to send the relief supplies.

00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:08.232
Wait. Be quiet.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.988
We recently reported that Nazareth,

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:16.324
a home that supports youth
in becoming independent,

00:51:16.407 --> 00:51:19.660
was at risk of being shut down
due to misunderstandings and rumors.

00:51:19.744 --> 00:51:22.997
However, two days ago, an anonymous donor
made a significant contribution,

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.042
and a new center is set to be built.

00:51:26.501 --> 00:51:28.085
A FEW DAYS AGO

00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:32.715
LET THIS BE USED TO NURTURE THE FUTURE

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.181
Sister.

00:51:41.057 --> 00:51:42.725
Sister!

00:51:43.643 --> 00:51:45.186
By the Lord's grace,

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:48.689
an anonymous brother who shares our spirit

00:51:48.773 --> 00:51:51.067
has bestowed upon us a profound blessing.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:52.652
So that's where it went?

00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:56.572
Give them this too. Give it to them.

00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:58.449
Whatever. You deserve to keep it.

00:51:58.533 --> 00:52:00.201
We're not running a charity here.

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:01.744
He's right. Gu-ho.

00:52:01.828 --> 00:52:04.205
Get yourself some snacks
with your little money.

00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:05.873
Up next.

00:52:05.957 --> 00:52:08.584
Jeon Tae-su,
chairman of the Sand Foundation,

00:52:08.668 --> 00:52:11.963
is under arrest for child abuse
and aggravated unlawful confinement.

00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:12.880
Jeon Tae-su.

00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:15.341
Police have discovered
that former Chairman Jeon

00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:18.135
subjected children to prolonged abuse
and unlawful confinement

00:52:18.219 --> 00:52:19.554
within the welfare center he ran.

00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:28.938
They will conduct an investigation…

00:52:29.021 --> 00:52:29.856
Yi-rang.

00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:33.776
Why did you choose Jeon Tae-su
of all people?

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.988
He seemed different from
the usual dirty laundry we've handled.

00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:41.868
She's sleeping.

00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:48.124
Well, that was fast. Let's go.

00:52:48.708 --> 00:52:49.625
-Okay.
-Follow me.

00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:55.710
25 YEARS AGO

00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:25.448
Too bad. I won again.

00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:29.326
Since you lost, you need to get punished.

00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:35.166
It's unfair.

00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:37.168
What's unfair?

00:55:41.172 --> 00:55:44.258
Oh, are you saying you keep losing

00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.010
because they scare you?

00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:48.637
No. I'm just way younger than you.

00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:50.598
But you're smarter than I am.

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:53.142
What if I can't outthink
all that life experience you have?

00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:54.852
And what if…

00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:56.979
And I'm just throwing it out there.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.608
But you could be smarter than I am.

00:56:04.195 --> 00:56:05.446
That makes sense.

00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:08.532
Fine. Then we'll play the game you want.

00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:10.326
What do you want to play?

00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:12.161
How about hide-and-seek?

00:56:13.913 --> 00:56:14.789
Sure.

00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:26.926
Go.

00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:37.561
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:56:38.437 --> 00:56:45.361
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:56:45.528 --> 00:56:47.947
I mean, is this really necessary?

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:54.411
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:56:55.037 --> 00:57:01.502
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:05.422
Hide tight, I can see your hair

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:16.433
Found you.

00:58:06.275 --> 00:58:11.447
ANY WORLD THEME PARK
KIDNAP CASE, MYUNG GU-HO, AGE 28

00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:00.037
An art critic well-versed
in all forms of artistic expression

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.164
and a major player
in the art business world.

00:59:02.248 --> 00:59:05.292
Then, today, will we get to see
an authentic masterpiece?

00:59:06.126 --> 00:59:08.337
All right. Let's find out who he is.

00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:11.632
Come to the gallery with the paintings.

00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:13.050
That crazy…

00:59:13.634 --> 00:59:15.010
He's a piece of trash

00:59:15.094 --> 00:59:17.221
who takes advantage of his status
to go after women.

00:59:18.389 --> 00:59:20.849
James, wait. Did we get caught?

00:59:21.642 --> 00:59:24.603
I'm the Head of Purchasing
for Wonderby Asia. Olivia Kim.

00:59:25.104 --> 00:59:29.108
We'll dangle the bait using
Mr. Famous' most powerful memories.

00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:30.025
Jeez!

00:59:30.693 --> 00:59:31.902
What's wrong? What happened?

00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:35.364
May I ask when you arrived in Korea?

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:38.867
You must have met
Soul Auction's legal team manager.

00:59:39.535 --> 00:59:40.828
Don't worry.

00:59:41.412 --> 00:59:45.791
What we need right now
is the perfect pushover.
