=Episode 11=

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.359
Like this?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.359
Still can't remember a thing?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.359
Hua.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.679
Hua.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.359
What's on your mind?

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.520
You look so lost in thought.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.560
I wasn't thinking about anything.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.280
Su Man'er

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.359
is staying with Miss Yu now.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.600
Do you want to see her?

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.560
How is she?

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.679
A bit emotional.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.079
She likely doesn't
want to see you either.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.200
Miss Yu checked her pulse.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.479
Turns out she's pregnant.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.280
As soon as she found out,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.480
she kept crying for Xiao Ye.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.120
She wouldn't see anyone else.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.760
She even threw me out.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.760
Go tell her,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.799
she needs to take care of herself.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.159
After a while,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.159
I'll let her see who she wants to see.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.599
Hua won't open up to me.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.560
I feel useless.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.359
But I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.519
I'd say you've done plenty, General.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.799
You even call for your dear
in your dreams.

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.159
Found anything on the thing
I asked you to investigate?

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.239
If I hadn't,

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.760
I wouldn't dare show my face here.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.000
Those guys aren't exactly tight-lipped.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.079
Before we even hit them,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.110
they spilled everything.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.280
They said Madam was looking
for a girl named Xiao Lian.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.159
So where is she now?

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.080
Your Minister of Revenue uncle

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.159
has more power than anyone should.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.620
With just a few words,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.639
he pinned a crime on her and
had her exiled to the frontier.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.879
Cui Liang, send someone after her.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.520
General?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.199
Xiao Ye and his uncle have
the King Of Xiling behind them.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.719
They have money and power.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.039
The people at the border

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.280
will never let her go.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.000
Xiao Lian is the key witness

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.990
to Zhang Yuanxing
and the others bending the law.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.719
At any cost,

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.000
she must be brought back.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.199
Alive.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.960
Hua.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.319
That's everything General owns.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.479
Will it work?

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.900
When have you ever seen me fail?

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.840
Come on, slower.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.199
This scheme could make a fortune.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.000
You must handle it carefully.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.560
And don't let Xiao Ye

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.879
or those two old ones
from the Xiao family find out.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.439
Once they get money,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.879
they won't listen to us anymore.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.879
Those two sly foxes.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.780
Who knows what trick they're up to?

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.159
The other day, I overheard

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.479
her little maid saying
they bought a lot of Suhe Luo.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.199
Suhe Luo? What even is that?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.080
Well?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.879
Why did you buy Suhe Luo?

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.199
What's it for?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.000
Still won't fess up?

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.400
Next time, it won't just be a slap

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.719
you must endure.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.439
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.439
Ye.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.400
This girl is stubborn.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.960
What should we do?

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.840
Aunt, you've done enough.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.079
Look at Nan Jiang's hands.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.720
So delicate and pretty.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.839
Such a pity.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.279
Hands this lovely

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.439
won't obey me.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:38.439
Hence, they're useless anyway.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.959
I'll talk.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.519
I'll talk!

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.279
She said

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.560
a few days ago she saw a Hu merchant

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.399
selling a spice called Suhe Luo.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.079
It's cheap,

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.759
but has a rare fragrance.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.040
It's one of a kind.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.240
You don't see it much in the market now.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.199
If it's made into incense,

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.040
it should sell really well.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.439
She wants to make more money

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.480
to smooth the way for General,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240
and buy him a higher rank.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:32.199
Sister, I've already asked around.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.959
That Suhe Luo was brought in last year

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.839
by a Hu merchant
from the Western Regions.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240
It carries a unique scent

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.199
unlike any other spice.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.639
If we seize the chance,

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.639
we can make a fortune.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.560
The birthday of Ye's godfather
is coming soon.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.880
We need money for the celebration.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360
No time to lose.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.639
Buy in bulk.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:53.439
But...

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.439
Sister,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.519
most of the Xiao Residence's wealth

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.079
has already been lost to Qing Yan.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.279
If we buy in bulk now...

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.199
Brother,

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.160
when you begged me to buy your post,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.439
did I ever say no?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.439
That's true.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.959
Thank you, Sister,
for buying me that position.

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:23.160
But alas,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.560
it's just a useless idle position.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.639
There are hardly any savings at home.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.639
Do you think I don't know?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.480
You've been colluding with brokers,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.279
sending others in place of the exiled.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.959
How much silver have you pocketed?

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.680
We're family, you and I.

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.800
And you're family to Ye as well.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.839
When I paid for your post,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.199
Ye heard about it

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.720
and even took from his own savings

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.199
to help you out.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.040
He said he wanted
his uncle to live well.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.439
And now Ye has been harmed by villains,

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.360
and doesn't even have
the money for a minor post.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.199
Yet you still keep making excuses.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.240
Mother.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.040
Please don't blame Uncle.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.639
When we helped him back then,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.279
it wasn't because

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.560
we expected him to repay us.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.480
But after all that has happened,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.959
I can't help but feel bitter.

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:27.759
I truly wanted what's best for Uncle.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.079
But I never thought

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:31.000
he cared so little

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.399
about his own nephew.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.160
If that's the case,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.439
I think Uncle should keep his distance

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.800
from my godfather.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.800
So Mother and I don't keep

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.240
wasting our hearts on the wrong people.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:49.839
If that's how it is,

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.199
I'll go raise the money

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.160
and buy the Suhe Luo.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.560
Thank you, Uncle.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.600
Cursed scoundrels.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.839
How could they do this to you?

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.879
It's been days
and you're still not healed.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.160
Nan Jiang,

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.439
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.680
Hua, as long as
Xiao Ye learns his lesson,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.439
what's a few small injuries?

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:21.959
But Hua,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.279
what's our next move?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.600
The Suhe Luo they bought isn't enough.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.879
We still need General

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:32.000
to play his part in the act.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.039
I really underestimated you.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.600
I risked my life,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.840
bled on the battlefield,
to build what little I have,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.440
and you've squandered it all.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.600
Now you see, General,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.080
what kind of person I really am.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.360
When we first met,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.080
did I ever show you my true face?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.840
I happen to have

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.000
a thousand faces.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.960
Which one you see

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.320
depends on which one you deserve.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.559
If you can't see clearly now,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.679
then one day I can carve it
on your tombstone,

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:59.440
so you'll see it plain as day in death!

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:00.440
Say that again.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.440
Go on, say it.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.919
Go, report to the Grand Madam.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.120
I'll hit you all I want!

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.279
Hua, General,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.559
the Grand Madam's spies are gone.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.879
Good. Understood.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.240
That was quite a performance.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.879
It certainly was.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:31.919
But you know,

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:34.200
you can put on a show too, General.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.240
When you finally
lay down your armor one day,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.879
you could make a living on the stage.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.879
Good thing I'm not your enemy.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.090
Otherwise,
hearing your scolding every day

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:45.440
would drive me mad.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.840
A general doesn't need a sharp tongue,

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.840
just a sharp blade.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.720
Why did you get these things

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.080
sent here?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.399
For fishing, of course.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.639
Fishing?

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.860
(Suhe Luo)

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.799
To fish properly,

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.679
you need to put in some bait.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.519
And your bait

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:18.039
is this pile of cheap spices?

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:20.240
The fish is big,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.399
but it stinks too.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.840
Spending real silver on them

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.279
just isn't worth it.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.080
So what are you planning
to do with these spices?

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:32.480
When General fights in battle,

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:36.159
many soldiers
under him fall on the field.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.320
And their families?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.360
They go into mourning.

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.559
And mourning means burning incense.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.399
But the cheap incense in the market

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.600
is toxic

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:45.759
if inhaled too much.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.080
Our family once dealt in spices.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.240
So,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.039
I know a thing or two.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.200
Once burned,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.039
these spices

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:55.000
aren't toxic.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.559
In fact, they soothe the mind.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:58.039
The soldiers are gone,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.240
their families shouldn't keep suffering.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.039
So this is your fishing method?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.559
You will know in time.

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.159
Yes.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.240
My wife is a master fisher.

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:16.200
She caught me with just one hairpin.

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:20.879
Why don't you wear it?

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.480
I'm not Miss Su.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.399
If I wear a golden hairpin,

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:27.000
what if Miss Su gets jealous?

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.559
Don't worry.

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:31.679
If she knows the reason,

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:33.919
she won't be upset.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.639
- This is bad!
- One move too late…

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.799
Bad news!

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:44.759
Bad news!

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:45.720
Don't panic,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.879
hold yourself together.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.279
Suhe Luo.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.080
It's the Suhe Luo!

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.039
Aunt.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.159
Didn't we already make this incense?

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:01.039
I don't know why,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360
but everyone is using it

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.159
at funerals.

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.519
And the scent is so distinct

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:08.799
that anyone who smells it

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.240
feels like a funeral is happening.

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.360
Now people think it's bad luck,

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:18.159
and no one will buy our incense anymore.
