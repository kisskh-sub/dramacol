00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.880
[Episode 37]

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.590
A wise ruler should be fair

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.000
with rewards and punishments.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.710
Given

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.000
Li Wei's contributions,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.600
he's already been rewarded.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.400
However,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.229
Li Shuang committed a grave crime.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.430
Your Majesty, please

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.990
punish her with no mercy.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.950
You, being so wise,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.710
should be able to tell me—

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.840
what crime has Li Shuang committed?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.630
Li Shuang

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.870
was captured on the battlefield,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.330
bringing disgrace to our state's prestige.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.680
Victory and defeat are common in war.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.710
If going on the battlefield is a crime,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.750
losing is a crime,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.630
and being captured is also a crime,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.470
then tell me, in this world,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.030
who would still be willing to
fight for our state

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.000
and risk their lives on the battlefield?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.430
Has Your Majesty forgotten

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.430
that it was exactly because
Li Shuang let our enemy escape back then

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.560
that this military disaster befell us?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.400
Grand General Li Wei
died in a foreign land,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400
while the one who started it all

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.240
returned without a scratch.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.120
I dare to assert

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.110
that Li Shuang

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.360
and the Duan family of Yao State

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.560
must be in collusion.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.480
Your Majesty,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.870
collaborating with the enemy

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.120
is a capital offense.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.030
If the peace that
General Li bought with his life

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.400
were to be shattered
by these ill-intentioned people,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.240
how could Grand General

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.360
rest in peace?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.590
Back in Lucheng,

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.960
I encountered danger several times,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.890
and Duan Aodeng also came to my aid.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.520
This time, Li Shuang's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.310
military campaign against the Yao State

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.590
was also my order.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.110
According to what you two are suggesting,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.770
doesn't that mean that I, too,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.590
am in collusion with the Yao State?

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.530
Your Majesty grew up with General Li

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.090
as childhood sweethearts,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.910
and Your Majesty once

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.710
wanted to make her your empress.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.240
Your Majesty, as the one
who holds the supreme throne,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.640
does this reasoning mean

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.950
you intend to show personal favoritism?

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.920
Insolence!

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.430
Your Majesty,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.430
the criminal Li Shuang

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.590
is merely an orphan
adopted by the Li family.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.240
The Li family

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.400
has been loyal for generations.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.520
In my opinion,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.079
not only should Li Shuang
be sentenced to the harshest punishment,

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.400
but her surname should also be stripped,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.030
and her name erased from

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.120
the Li family genealogy,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.840
so as not to

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.190
bring shame upon the Li family.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.520
We request Your Majesty's wise decision!

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.000
Your Majesty.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.590
Your Majesty.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.710
Since the day I, Li Shuang,
entered the General's Residence,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.890
I've been a daughter of the Li family.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.130
This will never change, even in death.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.950
How bold of you—

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.820
daring to meddle in
the affairs of our Li family!

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.460
On my way back, I heard

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.090
that after I was captured,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.720
you cowards

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.750
urged His Majesty
to fight against Yao State again.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.190
But when asked
who would step forward to fight,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.600
none of you responded.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.310
For all of you,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.630
is war

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.010
and life-or-death

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.159
such a trivial matter,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.600
as long as
it doesn't concern you personally?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.160
Your Majesty.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.960
Our Li family
has been loyal for generations.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.940
For letting Duan Aodeng go back then,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I have no defense,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.420
and my crimes are beyond forgiveness.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.070
If my death

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.120
can appease everyone's anger,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.220
I, Li Shuang, am willing to accept it.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.490
I only wish for you to remember

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.920
that today's peace

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.230
was hard-won.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.030
Please be sure to cherish it.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.659
I, Li Shuang, daughter of Li Wei,

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.250
request death from Your Majesty.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.100
Shuang!

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.780
Ting?

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.180
Why are you here?

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.000
I went to the palace gate to plead,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.159
but Muyang refused to see me.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.600
He only sent a eunuch to relay a message,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.260
saying I'm allowed to see you.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.870
You only have the time it takes
half an incense stick to burn. Be quick.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.430
Ting.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.240
Shuang.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.320
Shuang, don't worry.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.870
I have a way to save you.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.990
I can mobilize Father's troops.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.880
This is Father's command token.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.950
Put it away quickly!

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.390
Nonsense!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.530
Do you even know what you're doing?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.630
Father died on the battlefield,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.430
and you asked for death in the court.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.620
You both acted without concern,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.280
leaving the entire Li family in my hands.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.880
So now, I make the decisions.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.430
Whether it means besieging the city

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.680
or staging a jailbreak,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.920
I must get you out.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.950
You...

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.970
Go ahead, hit me!

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.040
My mind is made up anyway.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.030
If you think

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.800
you don't want to let the Li family down,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800
then beg Muyang to revoke his order.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.560
As long as you're willing to yield,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.360
he surely won't bear to kill you.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.040
If you want Father and me

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.440
to die with regrets,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.710
then go ahead with your plan!

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.920
If you dare stir up trouble,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.680
I'll surely kill myself in prison
to atone for my sins.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.240
Why?

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.480
You could live.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.210
You could stay with me forever.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.550
Why must you choose death?

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.970
You're like this,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.790
and Father was the same.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.240
You're both so cruel,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.440
leaving me all alone!

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.230
I'm doing this to protect Taijin's peace

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.240
and to preserve the honor
of the Li family!

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240
Letting Jin'an go

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.870
that day

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.870
was a grave mistake.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.809
I've betrayed the court's trust

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.370
and failed the people of Taijin.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.370
If I continue to live in disgrace,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.440
I would implicate
the Changfeng Army in disloyalty

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.240
and bring dishonor to the Li family!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.870
But at that time,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.870
you had no idea

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.630
that Jin'an was Duan Aodeng...

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.890
A mistake is a mistake!

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.910
The Li family has served in the military
for generations.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.510
How dare you act recklessly!

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.200
If you truly dare to cause trouble

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.750
and abuse your military power

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.280
for your personal desires,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.970
you would disappoint
Father's spirit in heaven.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.800
As your elder sister,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.530
I would have failed to guide you properly,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.990
and would surely live with regret
until the end of my life.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.880
You may leave.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.560
I have nothing more to say to you.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.790
Shuang!

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.750
I was wrong.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.720
I'm just scared.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.950
I'm afraid of being alone again.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.990
Father is already gone.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.810
How could you bear to leave me alone?

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.360
Don't cry.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.400
I said, don't cry!

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.030
Ting,

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.600
what is our Li family's motto?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.260
"Loyalty, courage, and selflessness."

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.600
It means loyalty,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.440
fortitude,

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.510
and selfless dedication to Taijin.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.030
A grown man

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440
crying like this—

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.080
is there even
a shred of courage or fortitude?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.320
As a member of the Li family,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.030
those three words—
loyalty, courage, and selflessness—

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.870
are the measure in our hearts.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.670
When faced with difficult choices,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.090
weigh them against our values,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.080
and you'll find the answer.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.870
Your character is upright and honest,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.310
and you're the finest child
of the Li family.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.310
Entrusting the Changfeng Army
and our Li family to you

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.980
wasn't just out of necessity.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.290
It was bound to happen eventually.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.350
Ting, don't be afraid.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.670
You're not alone.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.550
Behind you stand me,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.300
Father,

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.960
the entire Li family,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.030
and the Changfeng Army.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.190
We are all your strength

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.520
and also your responsibility.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.420
Do you understand?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.880
I understand.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.120
Good.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.510
Ting,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.710
I believe in you.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.070
From now on, the Li family

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.480
will be in your hands.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.440
Alright.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.440
Your Majesty,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600
Prince Annan requests an audience.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I, Duan Aodeng,

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.430
have come to beg for punishment
from Your Majesty.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.360
Rise and speak.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.600
During the war between the two states,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.630
I mistakenly killed our own soldiers,

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.960
which is my first crime;

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.270
I released enemy prisoners
without authorization,

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.390
which is my second.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.200
I have failed our state

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.460
and Your Majesty's grace.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.410
Therefore,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.270
I request to resign

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.640
from my position as General of Cavalry,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.040
to be stripped of my royal title,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.910
and to be removed from the imperial clan,

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.840
so as to atone for

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.480
my unforgivable crimes.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.390
I heard from Mr. Mo Yin

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.840
that over the past year, you were
under the control of treacherous people.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.150
And those you killed

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.010
were conspiring with
Consort Qin all along.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.680
You cannot be blamed for killing them.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.080
And your release of Li Shuang

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.600
was also with my tacit approval.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.600
Ze, you don't have to make excuses for me.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.460
Right or wrong,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.750
justified or not,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.010
my hands are stained with
the blood of my own people.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.870
Your Majesty,
by not ordering my punishment,

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.270
you've already shown mercy beyond the law.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.240
Now that Taijin and the Yao State

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.710
are finally at peace,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.660
with you ruling the court, Ze,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.600
you'll surely do your utmost to maintain
this peaceful and prosperous era.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.600
Therefore, there's no longer any need

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600
for Prince Annan.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.000
Aodeng,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.150
you've grown up.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.150
I am very pleased.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.010
But during this past year,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.950
what exactly did you go through?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.000
Ze.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.670
Over the past year,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.960
I was stranded in Taijin.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.120
I experienced life and death separations

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.760
and tasted both bitterness and sweetness.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.670
And the person who accompanied
and supported me through all this

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.790
was Li Shuang.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.200
I once briefly forgot her,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.760
and because of that,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.240
I hurt her deeply.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.390
Li Wei died in battle seeking peace,

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.070
and restoring peace

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.340
is exactly what Li Shuang wishes for.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.060
Now that everything has settled,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.480
the only thing I can do

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.960
is shed this military uniform

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720
and renounce

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.290
the title stained with my grievous sins.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.360
I'm doing this

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.240
both for her

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.380
and for the world.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.770
If that's the case,

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.050
I will grant your wish.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.400
Duan Aodeng, hear the imperial decree:

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.810
from this day forward,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.960
strip Prince Annan of his title,

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.030
revoke his royal rank,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.280
expel him from the royal family,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.720
and demote him to commoner status.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.430
Your Majesty.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.090
Secret reports from the Yao State reveal

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.400
that Duan Aodeng has voluntarily requested

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.390
to have his royal rank revoked,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.720
to be removed from the royal family,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.780
and to be demoted to commoner status.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.840
The ministers' wrath

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.700
still hasn't abated?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.360
Your Majesty has delayed granting
General Li execution—

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.500
how could the ministers possibly
let it rest?

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.830
I guess these memorials

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.500
contain similar complaints.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.000
If that's the case,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.150
it's time

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.950
to send General Li on her final journey.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:18.599
Please, General.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.680
These dishes

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.110
are all your favorites.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.210
If they're not to your liking,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.680
I can order them
to prepare something else.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.880
The floods

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.320
have ruined the harvest,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.200
and food is scarce and valuable.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.350
There's no need to waste it on

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.880
someone who's about to die.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.010
Do you remember this place?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.920
Years ago,

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.860
the Imperial Tutor used to teach here.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.440
One day after class,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.680
I encountered a group of noble boys

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.270
bullying a girl together.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.750
That was the first time we met.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.380
But unexpectedly,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.200
when I stood up for justice

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.660
and even fought with them,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.230
all I got was your cold response.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.550
Later, you told me

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.640
that only by always standing firm

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.370
could one avoid being bullied.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.540
I've always remembered those words.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.610
After all these years,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240
all those who once

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.550
looked down on me

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.010
and bullied me

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.660
have fallen one by one.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.150
Only I

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.770
remain standing here.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.830
And you

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.510
could have stood by my side.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.640
The past cannot be changed.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.410
Everything is different now.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.470
Why bother bringing it up again?

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.470
Since you understand times change,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.710
why

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.000
can't you be flexible?

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.550
Don't you realize

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.310
that day
when you begged for death in court,

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.440
you were actually

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.680
cutting off your own path to survival?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.310
Now

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.750
public opinion in court is boiling.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.750
Those ministers submit memorials daily,

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.590
urging me

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.390
to quickly issue an edict
for your punishment.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.160
Are you forcing me,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.440
or are you forcing yourself?

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.940
I led the army and suffered defeat,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.400
my father died,

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.200
and Jin'an left me.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.200
I've got nothing left
to hold on to in this life.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.340
Only by dying

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.790
can I preserve the Li family's honor

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.050
and calm the anger of the people.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.330
Your Majesty is a wise ruler.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.500
You must not show favoritism.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.150
I only ask for one thing.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.580
After I die,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.360
please take good care of Ting for me.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.230
In his heart,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.130
you've always been that

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.920
gentle

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.470
and righteous Muyang.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.740
This has never changed.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.460
What about you?

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.180
If we were born into ordinary families,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.890
and if there were no Jin'an,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.030
would you stay by my side?

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.600
Living life with "what if"s alone
is not enough.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.440
What's missed

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.470
is simply missed.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.130
I was once alone and helpless,

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.510
not knowing where in the wilderness
I would die.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.440
I never expected

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.510
to live this long.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.180
I've drawn mighty bows

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.090
and slain formidable enemies.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.160
This life of mine

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.640
can be considered extraordinary.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.020
I, Li Shuang, have no regrets,

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.050
and no complaints.

I didn't know you were coming, Ze.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.660
Forgive me for
not greeting you properly.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.750
Please excuse the modesty

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.750
of my humble home.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.600
Since you dismissed everyone
from your residence

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.460
and moved here,

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.980
I've rarely heard news of you.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.080
Seeing you content now,

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.430
I feel relieved.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.530
It's just though it appears peaceful,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.650
it does seem somewhat austere.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.510
How do you know

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.710
that the life I wanted

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.410
wasn't exactly like this, Ze?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.750
Shuang and I agreed

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.440
that once the world was at peace,

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.230
we would retreat to the mountains,

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.960
leave worldly affairs behind,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.160
and live a quiet and contented life.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.710
Unfortunately,

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.670
now we are

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.160
worlds apart.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.080
But the ways of the world
are unpredictable.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.360
Perhaps one day,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.670
when she's no longer Taijin's General,

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.800
we might meet again

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.720
somewhere in this world.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.200
News came from Taijin a few days ago

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.920
that Miss Li Shuang was accused of treason

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.800
and died suddenly in the palace

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.130
to prove her innocence.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.400
Soon,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.800
she'll be interred in
the imperial mausoleum.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.710
[Report on the Death of Li Shuang]

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.090
How could the great General of the North,
Li Shuang,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.250
with countless military achievements,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.710
be driven to her death?

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.930
When I let her go back then,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.660
I thought I could keep her safe.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.160
How could it turn out like this?

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:03.730
Those who rule a nation

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.030
face many impossible choices.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.330
Miss Li was determined to die.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.320
It must have been a decision made
after weighing all options.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.510
Stop right there.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.500
Such a sensitive matter

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.560
should have been kept secret

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.650
and handled discreetly,

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.670
yet Taijin rushed to announce it
to the world.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.560
Surely, this was intended to
draw you into the trap.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.990
Since Su Muyang will grant her
a proper burial,

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.600
why walk into their trap?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.000
She was my wife
who I swore to heaven to protect.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:39.270
I promised her

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.940
that in life we would be together,

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.580
and in death we would share the same tomb.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.750
I've already failed her once.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.960
I cannot abandon her a second time.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.430
How could I leave her
in that cold underground palace?

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.120
A burial in the imperial mausoleum

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.400
will surely be accompanied
by thousands of troops.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.320
How could you possibly contend with that?

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.030
Besides, after continuous wars,

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.320
both the Yao State and Taijin

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.670
have lost too much.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.800
Peace has finally been achieved.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.600
If you go and ignite another war,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.450
how should you explain yourself
to the world?

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.370
I will go to Wuling Mountain

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.130
to retrieve Jade Linglong.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.730
After I bring Shuang back,

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.750
I will atone with my life.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.280
I'll never allow war to break out again.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.400
Ze.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.560
When your wife passed away,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.880
how did you feel?

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.510
You wanted to pass the throne to me then,

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.470
but I refused.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.650
You were so anxious and angry.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.030
That was the first time in my life

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.890
I saw you lose your composure, Ze.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.670
I understood even then

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.380
that you hated being bound by the throne,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.810
lacking the freedom
to follow your wife in death.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.570
The moment I received news of her,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.910
I knew it would end this way.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.430
But how could I stand by

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.670
and watch my only brother go to his death?

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:23.950
Yet sometimes,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.600
I can't help but envy you.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.290
Since you've made up your mind,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.100
all I can do as your brother

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.480
is to support your decision.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.470
Thank you, Ze.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:20.880
Please convey

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.080
that Duan Aodeng from the Yao State

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.990
requests to see Master Mo.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.400
Master knew you would come,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:24.950
so

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.360
he specifically ordered me
to wait here for you.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.560
This way please, Sir.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.640
Mr. Mo Yin,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880
how have you been?

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.560
I'm more used to the way

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.430
you used to treat me casually,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.380
calling me by my name
without any formality.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.320
Jin'an.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.960
Actually, you've disguised yourself
very well.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.410
But since we've known each other
for quite some time,

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.800
there are always some details

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.950
that give you away.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.330
I believe Li Shuang felt the same.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.910
Since you, Mr. Mo Yin,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.790
already predicted I would come,

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.800
I suppose

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.800
you already know what happened to Shuang.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:47.930
I beg you, Mr. Mo Yin...

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.130
Forgive me, but this is beyond my power.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.150
Matters of life and death

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.880
are not for man to control.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.040
All things arise and perish

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.220
by the law of cause and effect.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.730
You cannot force it.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.300
Since it cannot be forced,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.469
the only thing left
is to do my best to make amends.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:09.929
What Duan Aodeng can't do,

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.489
I, Jin'an, can.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:19.850
I beg you, Mr. Mo Yin,

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.600
to lend me Jade Linglong.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.630
Are you insane?

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.840
Only with Jade Linglong

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.070
can I bring Shuang back

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:32.280
on the day of her burial.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.239
Back then, in order to retrieve
Jade Linglong,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.400
you endured so much pain

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.800
and nearly died.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.550
Have you forgotten all that?

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.600
I haven't forgotten.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.100
But for Shuang's sake,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.760
I don't care.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.150
She's already gone.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.330
Who are you putting on this act for?

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.920
You clearly remembered everything
back then,

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.380
so why didn't you tell her?

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.550
When you should have cherished her,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.010
you let her down so easily.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.030
Now that she's already dead,

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.670
why pretend to be so heartbroken again?

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.590
I'm truly guilty toward her.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.460
There's no denying it.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.600
If you had realized your guilt earlier,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.460
Shuang wouldn't have ended up like that.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.310
You should go.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.550
I can't help you.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.040
I swear with my blood.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.720
I beg you, Sir,

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.950
to lend me Jade Linglong.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.340
After I bring Shuang back,

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.470
I'm willing to die

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.800
to ensure that Jade Linglong

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.370
is returned intact.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.630
Duan Aodeng!

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.280
Jade Linglong is Wuling Mountain's
greatest treasure.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.140
How dare you think
you can just take it as you please?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.180
What's happening?

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.870
Oh no.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.870
I'm afraid
Jade Linglong is about to awaken.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:17.780
Master!

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.210
-Master!
-Master!

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:20.400

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.730
