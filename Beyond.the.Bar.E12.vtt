BEYOND THE BAR

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:45.504
Goodness.

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:40.183
YOU GOT THIS!

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.565
Yes?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.738
Mr. Yoon,

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.698
Ms. Seol is here.

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.247
Hash is tough,

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.750
and he's already recovered
so much in just a day.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.668
I said I'd pick him up.

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:08.670
I was heading downtown anyway.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.173
I'll go pick him up for the time being.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.091
Don't leave him at the hotel.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:14.259
It's far.

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.303
Wouldn't it be easier to use the hotel?

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.262
It's not far.

00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:20.223
Okay.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:22.517
Do what you want.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.355
About what I said yesterday…

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.191
Let's not talk about that anymore.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.109
I don't want to talk about something

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.153
so pointless.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:35.447
I understand.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.618
I've given it a lot of thought.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.914
I think it'd be better

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.874
if you took care of Hash.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:50.712
Are you sure?

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.215
Under one condition.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:55.509
What is it?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.679
Whether it's a roommate

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.681
or a wife,

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:03.016
I want you to find someone
to raise Hash with.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.142
Then you can have custody.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.394
What do you say?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:07.813
Deal.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:15.237
<i>Heart Logic</i>

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.031
doesn't rely on manual matching
like traditional matchmaking companies.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.033
We use AI to analyze the info you enter

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:22.536
about your ideal type
and match you automatically.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.746
We turn your preferences into data

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.499
and recommend the ideal matches for you.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:31.336
Another unique feature is that you meet
without seeing photos or profiles.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.755
It's literally a blind date,
just as the term suggests.

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.757
<i>People meet without photos or profiles?</i>

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.759
Yes. In fact,
the success rate is much higher

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.553
when you meet
without having any information.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.430
And we don't limit the number of dates

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.932
like traditional matchmaking companies do,

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.976
so you can meet your matches
with no pressure.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.644
As long as your schedule allows,

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.438
you can get unlimited matches for a year.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.689
Would you like to--

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.899
Mommy, I need to pee.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:54.025
Go find Dad.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:55.861
<i>- I see.</i>
- Yes.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.446
<i>You do verify your members, right?</i>

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.739
Of course!

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.616
We conduct rigorous manual verification.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.167
LOVE YOU, MOM AND DAD

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.133
I'll get going.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.969
I'm just having one face-to-face meeting
and heading straight back home.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.305
Really? Then can you pick up Min
on your way back?

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.765
Why?

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.225
I'll probably have dinner with Sang-min.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.186
Is that so?

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.606
I was thinking the three of us
could have a family dinner.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.608
- Let's do that tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.986
Are you still in the talking stage,

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.906
or are things moving forward?

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:43.241
I don't want to discuss my dating life.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.870
It's weird. After all,
you're my legal husband.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.122
Okay. I'm off.

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:50.457
Bye.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.785
I'm home.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.745
Where were you?

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.414
Min said you went
to take out the recycling.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.291
Where's Min? Is he asleep?

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.251
Yes.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.128
Have you been drinking?

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.214
Yes, a little.

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:47.597
So,

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.600
about our living arrangement…

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.270
Are you sure this is okay?

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:55.438
What's going on?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.359
I…

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:01.403
I think…

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.031
I have feelings for you.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:09.703
When I think about you with another man,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.080
I get jealous,

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:13.915
and I can feel

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.376
something hot

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.879
- boiling up in here.
- Min-chan.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.883
This is a breach of contract.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:24.843
Our co-parenting agreement

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.179
has no real meaning in Korea.

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.098
What are you saying?

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.142
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:35.687
Do you think we are truly

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.398
happy in this loveless family?

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.110
Love is a feeling
that can change over time.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.070
A family built on nothing but that feeling

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:47.282
will eventually make you miserable,
and it will end in divorce.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.450
I don't want

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.202
to raise Min in a divorced family.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.458
I think…

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.420
I really love you.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:06.134
I'm sorry.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.595
I don't want…

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.222
to break our family apart.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.230
Okay.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.070
In that case,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.155
we should get divorced.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.699
I'm really sorry,

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.745
but I don't want to live
in a loveless family.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.416
I want us to be a real couple.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:49.469
BEYOND LOVE'S VOW

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.680
A breach of contract?

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.682
What kind of breach of contract?

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.600
Co-parenting agreement.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:59.437
We agreed to raise our child together
without a marital relationship.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.856
I'm not sure if I'm following.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.026
Min-chan and I got married without love.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.738
We believed that such a marriage
would be more stable,

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.617
so we agreed to have a child through IVF
and not interfere in each other's lives.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:16.371
So, there was no physical relationship
with your husband?

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.289
No. Not even once.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.754
I met Min-chan in the US,

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.506
where I found people like us

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:29.300
who believed that love
can actually ruin a marriage.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.553
There was an online platform
that connected such people,

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.221
and that's where I met him.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.224
I see.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.730
Both Min-chan and I grew up

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.524
in divorced families.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.317
So, having experienced firsthand

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.029
how unstable a marriage
based on love can be,

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.321
we joined the platform.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.575
In the US, depending on the state,

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.077
contracts like this
may be recognized legally.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.454
The chances of such a contract

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.082
being recognized
by a Korean court seem low.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.335
If it's determined that such a contract
goes against public order and morals,

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.254
it can be declared void.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.549
What do you mean by that exactly?

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:13.178
It refers to the basic moral values
and public order of society.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.056
For example, a "concubine contract"
that went against the monogamy system

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.768
was ruled void
for violating public order and morals.

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.227
A "concubine"?

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.771
Yes.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.939
Another case involving a contract

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:28.276
in which a married person agreed to marry
a specific person after divorcing

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:32.447
was declared void
for violating ethics and social order.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.200
But my contract with him
isn't anything weird like that.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.661
Taking on a concubine
or agreeing to marry someone else

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.371
is in itself against basic human ethics.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:43.208
But we simply found ourselves
a better form of marriage,

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.877
one that doesn't rely
on imperfect emotions.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.295
I understand.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.131
But from the court's perspective,

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:51.966
it could be seen as fundamentally denying

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.594
the traditional concept of marriage

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:57.722
since sexual union
and emotional bonds are regarded

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.016
as essential to a marital relationship.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.392
I see.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.105
But why do you see it
as a breach of contract?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.565
My husband ended up
falling in love with me.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.568
He wants us to be
like other married couples.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.903
And I'm not interested.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:13.988
Now, he wants to divorce me.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.449
But I don't want to get divorced.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.535
I like how things are now,

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.787
just as we agreed in the contract.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.341
<i>Whether it's a roommate</i>

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:34.801
or a wife,

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.970
I want you to find someone
to raise Hash with.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.429
Then you can have custody.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:50.900

REQUEST SUBMITTED

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:18.011
Min-ji told me you are
the CEO of a matchmaking agency.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:19.679
Yes, I am.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.850
It operates in a more progressive way
than traditional ones.

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.519
This is my agency's brochure. Have a read.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.106
It might be a bit soon
to think about getting married,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.025
but if you're going to,
now's the right time.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.027
I got Min-ji to sign up too.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.486
She told me.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.823
We have a discount for acquaintances.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:39.991
Okay.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.286
It's rather ironic

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:47.040
that someone who doesn't believe in love
is in the matchmaking business.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.499
That's why I can run the business.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.002
Love is about feelings,
but marriage is about reality.

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:53.713
It's not a promise to love forever.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.758
It's simply a lifetime contract
to live together.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.801
Compatibility is more important
than feelings

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.720
when it comes to spending life together.

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.597
Introductions through friends are limited.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.308
It's not easy
to find a good match by chance.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.560
In a matchmaking agency,

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.771
you have access to a much larger pool,

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.439
so the odds are in your favor.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.526
- I look forward to working with you.
- I do too.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.323
<i>Give me a break.</i>

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.283
How can she have a child
without being intimate?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.576
Who is she, the Virgin Mary?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.953
Through IVF.

00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:27.705
That thing for infertile couples?

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.208
It's not exclusively for that these days.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.294
So you're saying the husband
wants to divorce his wife because…

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:36.130
Because he ended up
falling in love with his wife.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:37.715
Isn't it just weird?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.009
He wants to divorce her
because he loves her?

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.179
What is it that the client wants?

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.891
She wants to legally enforce
the co-parenting agreement.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:49.102
She also wants to claim
the one billion won penalty

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.895
specified in the contract.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.565
The purpose of that
isn't so much to get compensation

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.192
as it is to use it as leverage

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.903
to avoid divorce
and keep living as they are now.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.240
But will judges actually
see that as a valid contract?

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.825
I told her it could be void

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.077
if it's deemed
to be against public order and morals.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.662
It's pissing me off.

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:09.247
What is?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.373
You see,

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.583
she's violating
the sacred marriage system.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.921
Don't project your emotions
onto it too much.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.214
Did I?

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.175
These days, a lot of married couples
have affairs and sexless marriages.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.136
Couples that are just for show.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.639
But these people left emotions out
from the start by contract.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.975
Couples that are just for show
keep it hidden.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.352
They're basically the same.
Marriages without love.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:32.687
No.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.230
They must have been in love at first,

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.940
so it's a marriage where love has faded.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.318
Maybe marriage isn't
the culmination of love

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.611
but the process of exhausting it.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:41.904
Look at you people.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.657
Why are you so negative about marriage?

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.035
I'm not saying what I think.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.203
I'm just saying how it is these days.

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:53.082
People half-jokingly say
marriage should be renewed every 20 years.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:57.170
When marriage became an institution,
people would only live to about 50 or 60.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:58.921
People live up to 100 these days,

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.382
so the idea of loving
only one person for life

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.384
can seem a bit unrealistic.

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:05.470
If anything, having an expiration date

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.846
might make people try harder--

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.097
Whatever.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:12.518
I don't care how other people live
or what they think.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.438
I just want to marry
someone I love deeply,

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.856
shower her with love forever,

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.025
and even when I'm old,
I'd use all my energy to--

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.236
Okay. That's enough.

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:26.908
What do you think, Mr. Yoon?

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:28.451
Does it make sense to get married

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.536
solely for the purpose
of having and raising a child

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.954
without intimacy or affection?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.874
Some people even consider marriage
just so they can have a dog.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.252
Sorry?

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.381
You see,

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:42.882
love is a feeling,

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.051
and feelings can change at any time.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:47.929
On the other hand,

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:50.640
marriage is essentially
a fixed lifelong contract,

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.308
so the two won't always coincide.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:57.230
So I can see why someone
would choose to build a family

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.191
based on the responsibility
of co-parenting,

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:04.278
instead of relying
on the uncertainty of emotions.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:07.198
That's unexpected, coming from a romantic.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:08.408
A romantic?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.910
Mr. Yoon?

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:13.704
- Not anymore, apparently.
- No.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.253
Anyway, I want to take this case.

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.381
Public order and morals
are not fixed concepts.

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:25.425
They can be understood differently

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.343
depending on the era and social norms.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.220
I also believe that marriage

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.931
should now be viewed in more diverse ways.

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:33.349
Can I take this case?

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:34.809
Yes.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.102
I'll join her.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.105
- Go ahead.
- Good grief.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.575
Tell me if you feel any pain.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:51.534
Okay.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.332
I thought it would hurt, but it doesn't.

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.500
Right?

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:03.296
This is the most popular treatment
these days.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:07.216
You'll see the improvement
if you get the treatment regularly.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.260
Okay, thanks.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:11.846
- I'm so glad.
- I'll introduce them.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.145
Ms. Heo Min-jeong, over here!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.317
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.444
This is my friend, Lee Gyeong-hui.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:28.571
She's Jin-woo's big sister.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.575
How do you do?

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.368
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.455
You're the reason
I got a fresh start in life.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:42.168
So, for winning the case, I figured
I'd treat you and invite Gyeong-hui

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.629
since she's the one
who referred you to me.

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:45.922
That's great.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.006
Please.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:54.639
So, you and Jin-woo work on the same team?

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.058
Yes, we started at the same time,
so we get along well.

00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.726
I see.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.647
Then you must be around the same age.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.940
Same age, apparently.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.233
As Jin-woo?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.317
No.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.819
- As us.
- Are you for real?

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.239
- You're 42?
- Yes.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.325
You must take
really good care of yourself.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:18.663
I thought you and Jin-woo
were only a year or two apart.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.414
But a ten-year gap?

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.834
How do you have zero age spots?

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:27.088
Your complexion is amazing.

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.757
It's because I went
to the dermatologist yesterday.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.175
Really?

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.177
That's why you were glowing!

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.012
What did you get done?

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.931
I had a treatment for my age spots.

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:39.433
They definitely look lighter now,

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.561
and my skin texture seems better too.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:47.775
With that ten-year gap,

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:50.903
Jin-woo must seem like a baby to you.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:54.365
No, not particularly.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.034
He's only a baby to you.

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:58.869
Jin-woo is 32 now.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.788
- I know.
- Yes.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.834
It's about time he got married,

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:07.086
but there hasn't been any news at all.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:08.713
Doesn't he have a girlfriend?

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.964
I don't think so.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.010
Does he?

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:15.928
Well,

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:19.390
I'm not so sure.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:20.391
Ms. Heo.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.020
Please take care of my brother

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.104
like a big sister.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.982
If you know anyone nice,
you could introduce…

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.528
I guess everyone you know
must be older than him.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:34.697
They are, right?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.241
I guess so.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:39.160
Why can't he meet someone older?

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:40.995
Are you serious?

00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:43.456
Jin-woo doesn't like older women.
I don't, either.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.082
My family wouldn't approve.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.918
A gap of a couple years is fine.

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:50.880
No way. They need to have a baby.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.966
- Right, a baby.
- Yes.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.177
- This is good.
- This place is famous.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.136
Enjoy, Ms. Heo.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.179
Thanks.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.737
What's up?

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:22.995
About our dinner…

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.623
- Yeah?
- I forgot I had plans.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:26.791
What plans?

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.543
Just some plans.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.545
Let's have dinner another time.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.846
What's her deal?

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:48.813
Hey, Gyeong-hui.

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:50.231
Yes.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:52.692
When?

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:54.527
With Ms. Heo?

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:03.828
Let's talk for a second.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.627
You really have plans this evening?

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.629
Yes.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:14.588
Don't lie.

00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.175
Why didn't you tell me
you met my eldest sister?

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.431
What did she say
to make you avoid me again?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.392
She didn't say much.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:30.521
We both know what it's about.

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.357
I tried to ignore it, but I can't.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.445
Okay. You're ten years older than me.

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:39.280
You're divorced and have a kid.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.032
But I still love you.

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:45.286
Are you going to play hide-and-seek
every time this comes up?

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.123
If you start dating now,
marriage comes next.

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:50.875
But are we even compatible?

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.710
You can date
without checking all the boxes,

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.503
- but marriage is different.
- Checking boxes?

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:55.713
Look.

00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:58.507
Marriage is something you do
when you're crazy in love.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.426
What determines a good match or a bad one?

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.636
Isn't love what really matters
in marriage?

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.556
Jeez.

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:09.435
Marry me.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.020
What?

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.315
Let's get our families' blessing
and get married.

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.402
I bet your family will be over the moon.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:21.572
So what if they're not?
You'll be living with me, not them.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:25.493
Listen carefully.

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:29.955
I'm done sidelining myself for love.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:33.501
I love you, but I'm more important to me.

00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.545
I love myself more than you.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.716
It's the only way I can ever repay my mom.

00:21:46.597 --> 00:21:47.473
What?

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.309
What did you just say?

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:53.521
- Say what?
- Say what you just said.

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:55.439
I love myself more.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.608
No, right before that.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.903
I love you, but I'm…

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:06.158
You can't just drop that on me.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.117
I'm all shaken up.

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:10.538
Trust me.

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:14.124
I'll never let you feel less than you are.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:15.918
Never.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.013
Where's Ms. Kwon?

00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.682
She's out for a while.

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:34.603
I was going to give you a call.

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:35.563
About what?

00:22:37.565 --> 00:22:39.316
I got a call from Ban Gi-seung.

00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:47.616
Just as we suspected,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.119
Mr. Ko orchestrated the whole thing.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.537
I knew it.

00:22:52.162 --> 00:22:53.831
Now we just need to find the evidence.

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.082
Yes.

00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:57.167
He's agreed to hand over
all the key evidence.

00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:59.587
Did they seem to be on bad terms?

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.796
Of course they are.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.506
That's why he came to me.

00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:06.218
From Ban Gi-seung's standpoint,

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:09.722
if he admits that Mr. Ko
orchestrated everything,

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:12.391
he'll lose his license
for breaching the OEM rules.

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:16.186
If he says the asset management company
handled everything independently,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.981
he'll be on the hook
for over 80 billion won in damages.

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.191
Either way, it's a dead end.

00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:24.194
On top of that, I hear Mr. Ko

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.239
is trying to pin everything
on Ban Gi-seung.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:33.370
LEE JIN-WOO

00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:37.291
<i>The organization that supported Mr. Ban</i>

00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:40.294
<i>is the Seunghun Foundation,</i>
<i>operated by Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.</i>

00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:46.383
Did you give our information to him?

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:49.219
He asked me where I hid
the technical documents,

00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:50.679
so I said there's no such thing

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:53.432
and that it's all
in Mr. Lee Seong-bin's head.

00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:59.772
- Why?
- It doesn't seem like Mr. Ban

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:01.982
would betray Mr. Ko.

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:05.569
What if Mr. Ko sent him
to see what we're up to?

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.072
Why do you think that?

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:11.909
He got backing from Mr. Ko's foundation.

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.077
He did?

00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:16.789
Then Mr. Ban would also be
one of Mr. Ko's protégés.

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:17.831
Mr. Ko's protégés?

00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:18.916
Yes.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.543
Law firms are all about people,

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:23.671
and Mr. Ko has got that down to an art.

00:24:23.754 --> 00:24:26.423
He used his persuasion skills
to run another venture built on people.

00:24:26.507 --> 00:24:29.259
He nurtured talent
through corporate and client sponsorships

00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:31.929
and built networks
to strengthen his client base.

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:35.265
He has a knack for developing people
and reaping the benefits.

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:38.435
Mr. Ban Gi-seung is probably
one of them too.

00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:40.938
Ko Seung-cheol's protégés.

00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:43.565
Still,

00:24:44.274 --> 00:24:46.777
if his life's on the line,
he'll want to find a way out.

00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:50.823
They're handing over

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.284
all the evidence at four o'clock
the day after tomorrow.

00:24:54.368 --> 00:24:56.620
We'll know the truth then.

00:24:57.454 --> 00:24:58.330
Yes.

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.128
- Take it easy.
- You too.

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:17.850
Can we get a drink after work?

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:20.269
Is something wrong?

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:23.147
This is about
the most important thing in my life.

00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:25.315
I need you to hear me out.

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.484
- Okay.
- Can Hyo-min join us?

00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:28.861
Why her?

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:31.530
I'm not sure if she'll be any help,

00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:33.991
but I need someone
with a female perspective.

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:34.950
Okay.

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.077
Thanks.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:51.842
I'm dating Min-jeong.

00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:54.845
I knew it.

00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.931
Since lunch the other day,
you were acting weird.

00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.349
You're not even surprised.

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.269
Anyway, I want to get married.

00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:05.064
- With whom?
- With whom?

00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:07.274
I just told you.

00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:09.610
I'm dating Min-jeong.
Who else could it be?

00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:11.111
Why are you so surprised?

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:12.863
Things are moving too fast.

00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:14.698
Exactly. Very fast.

00:26:14.782 --> 00:26:16.742
- And?
- And?

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:17.701
Jeez.

00:26:17.785 --> 00:26:18.911
What are you, his echo?

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.370
Out with it.

00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:22.081
You want to marry her, and what?

00:26:26.877 --> 00:26:28.796
I'm thinking about popping the question,

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:32.299
but she sounded like
she's not big on marriage.

00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:35.928
So I figured I'd get your advice

00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:37.638
on how to pop the question.

00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.099
Nothing beats the classics.

00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:43.477
How about reciting
your personally written vows of love?

00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:47.689
Very simple,
yet very intuitive. I love it.

00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:48.816
So, what should I write?

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:52.236
I'd love to help you out,

00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:54.196
but I have no idea.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.781
I'm not even sure

00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:58.283
if marriage and love go together.

00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:00.244
You're not helping me at all.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:01.370
How about you?

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:03.413
Me?

00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:10.838
I think…

00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:14.466
marriage is built on love.

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:19.304
Over time, that love just changes shape.

00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:21.306
How so?

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.767
Love between a couple

00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:27.229
starts with passion, goes through reality,

00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:30.107
and ends in solidarity.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.984
Losing passion

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.987
doesn't mean losing love.

00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:39.199
Solidarity, loyalty, belonging.

00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:42.286
They're all just different forms of love.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.418
I've got an answer.

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:50.836
Wait.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.172
Can I use that for my vows?

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.506
Let me borrow your words.

00:27:55.007 --> 00:27:56.091
What did you say?

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:00.137
"Love starts with passion."

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.555
"Goes through reality."

00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:03.348
I know.

00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:05.058
"Goes through reality."

00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:08.103
"And ends in solidarity."

00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:12.232
- Just one more round.
- One more round.

00:28:12.983 --> 00:28:14.651
- One more round!
- One more round!

00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:16.945
You two can go ahead.

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:25.746
Just one more, then.

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:27.372
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.417
You're just chugging it.

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.170
- Excuse me!
- Yes.

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:34.630
- One more soju, please!
- Sure.

00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:36.506
Thanks.

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:40.177
Cheers! Thank you.

00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.225 line:20%
You can do it, Jin-woo!

00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:48.769 line:20%
Go, future groom!

00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:35.274
COURT

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:46.576
If they say this,
we have to bring this up.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.744
Okay?

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.081
Here they are.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.544
Long time no see, Ms. Kang.

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:58.088
You've got yourself an interesting case.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.270
Why can't the plaintiff ask for a divorce?

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:15.564
The plaintiff seeks a divorce,

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:18.025
claiming that the defendant
had feelings for someone else.

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:20.944
However, according
to Article 841 of the Civil Act,

00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:23.030
a divorce cannot be filed

00:30:23.113 --> 00:30:25.365
if the other party's misconduct
occurred with prior consent

00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:27.326
or if it was forgiven after the fact.

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.954
In this case, the plaintiff and defendant
agreed at the time of their marriage

00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:33.248
to have no emotional or physical ties,

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:35.083
to allow separate romantic relationships,

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:38.378
and to only share child-rearing duties.

00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:42.466
This constitutes prior consent
under Article 841 of the Civil Act.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:45.177
So if someone gives prior consent
for an affair,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.137
or if they forgive an affair
after the fact,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.139
they can't file for divorce over it?

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.475
- No.
- Right.

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:53.185
She's good.

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:54.936
That's what Hyo-min is using here.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.064
The plaintiff is not only claiming

00:30:57.147 --> 00:31:00.067
that the defendant
had a fling with another man

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.945
but also that he can no longer endure
a loveless, sexless marriage.

00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:06.490
Even if there had been prior consent,

00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:08.909
it has now been clearly withdrawn.

00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:11.495
Do you not understand
the meaning of a contract?

00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:14.247
Does a contract become null and void
if it's retracted unilaterally?

00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:15.916
A contract?

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:17.959
Yes, that contract is void.

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:21.338
From day one, that deal
excluded love and intimacy

00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:23.673
and even allowed them to date others.

00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:25.467
It denies the essence of marriage.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.095
That contract goes against
public order and morals. It's void.

00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:31.014
In short, a loveless,
sexless marriage itself is a violation

00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:32.140
of public order and morals.

00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:35.685
If a loveless marriage is a violation
of public order and morals,

00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:39.106
does that invalidate any marriage
based solely on practical conditions?

00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:41.733
By that logic, couples
whose love has faded or who are sexless

00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:43.735
should all get divorced.

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.239
A marriage is not only
a union where a couple's feelings align.

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:49.866
The couple also shares
intentions and life purposes.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.411
The plaintiff and the defendant
made this agreement

00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:53.829
for the purpose of child-rearing,

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:56.415
and they have successfully maintained
their family without issues.

00:31:56.498 --> 00:32:00.877
However, the plaintiff now seeks
to break up this stable household,

00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:03.046
citing nothing more than
a change of feelings.

00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.132
Your Honor,

00:32:05.215 --> 00:32:08.510
this agreement directly denies
the marital obligations

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.846
of cohabitation, support, and cooperation

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:12.889
stipulated in Article 826
of the Civil Act.

00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:14.558
Should the court allow this,

00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:16.518
it may result in significant confusion

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:19.312
in the legal system governing
spousal relations under the Civil Act.

00:32:19.396 --> 00:32:21.064
Furthermore, the Supreme Court holds

00:32:21.148 --> 00:32:23.442
that sexual relations
are essential to marriage,

00:32:23.525 --> 00:32:28.029
and a prolonged refusal without cause
can be grounds for divorce.

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:31.199
If the defendant wants to keep
this marriage so desperately,

00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:32.701
she could sleep with the plaintiff.

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:36.538
Are you telling her to sleep with a man
she doesn't even love?

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.248
So why get married

00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:41.084
when you don't even love the guy?

00:32:41.168 --> 00:32:44.463
Because love is an imperfect,
exhaustible, and temporary emotion.

00:32:44.546 --> 00:32:46.882
That's why not everyone who's in love
gets married

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.468
and not everyone
who gets married is in love.

00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:51.136
You know that better than anyone.

00:32:58.143 --> 00:33:00.187
Your Honor,

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:04.483
the case cited by the plaintiff's counsel
is only a standard for a typical marriage

00:33:04.566 --> 00:33:07.444
and cannot be applied
when there was a clear agreement

00:33:07.527 --> 00:33:09.237
before marriage
not to have sexual relations.

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.031
Okay, then. Let me ask you this.

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.658
Put all the feelings and sex aside.

00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:15.368
Are you saying you want the court

00:33:15.452 --> 00:33:17.829
to permit a married woman
to see another man?

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:20.832
Hang on. I find this very offensive.

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:24.085
You seem to think our contract violates
public order and morals or whatever.

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:25.921
What was it that I heard?

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.465
A concubine contract?
I heard this applies to things like that.

00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:32.677
The contract we made
was not immoral or abnormal.

00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:37.682
He knows it better than anyone.
He's using his lawyer as his mouthpiece.

00:33:37.766 --> 00:33:40.769
I won't see Sang-min anymore.

00:33:42.062 --> 00:33:43.104
Would that do?

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:45.273
Defendant,

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:46.399
please calm down.

00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:49.027
Your Honor,

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.363
there wouldn't be an issue

00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:54.783
if we remove the contract's
open relationship clause, right?

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.285
Wouldn't it be
a severely outdated judgment

00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:01.748
to say that this contract is void solely
because it's a loveless, sexless marriage?

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.251
Regarding that matter,

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:06.795
the court will make
a comprehensive judgment.

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:09.923
Your Honor,

00:34:10.006 --> 00:34:13.009
this contract is based
on sexual self-determination

00:34:13.093 --> 00:34:15.762
and social responsibility
towards child-rearing

00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.098
and does not violate public order.

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:21.893
The institution of marriage evolves
with time and alongside culture.

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:26.022
Two people from divorced families
entered this contract

00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:29.067
to provide a better environment
for their child.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.987
Clear rules were necessary to ensure

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.406
predictability in child-rearing
and daily life.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.746
I understand.

00:34:42.372 --> 00:34:44.958
The court will carefully determine
whether this contract represents

00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:48.837
an evolved form of marriage
or a structure that undermines

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.672
the institution itself.

00:34:51.506 --> 00:34:54.551
The law represents
the minimum threshold of morality.

00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:57.929
In reviewing this case,
we will consider the nature of marriage

00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:59.764
and the principle
of public order and morals.

00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:02.392
File any additional submissions
by the deadline,

00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:05.020
and we'll set the next hearing date.

00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:11.526
Let's talk for a minute.

00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:17.365
About what?

00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:19.618
I go on blind dates every week.

00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.077
Sometimes three times a week.

00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:22.245
So?

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.040
Every time I meet someone,
I regret what I did.

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:25.999
And I wonder

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.585
why I did that to you.

00:35:30.503 --> 00:35:33.214
I meant everything
I said in court earlier.

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:35.258
A marriage without love doesn't work.

00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:37.010
Even if I find someone
who's a better match,

00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:39.012
what's the point if I don't love them?

00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:41.222
You're not right for me.

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:42.182
Why not?

00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:44.517
I'll be better.

00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:48.480
Forget love. You're not loyal.

00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:52.734
I wouldn't date someone like that,
let alone marry them.

00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:10.752
It's been 20 minutes. Where is he?

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.212
I'll give him a call.

00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:16.091
HYNIC CORE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHOI CHIL-HYEON

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.760
What is Mr. Choi from Hynic Core
calling me for?

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:22.055
- Who's that?
- The head of technology.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:23.306
Go ahead.

00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:26.101
Hello.

00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.145
Yes.

00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:31.690
What? Now?

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:39.739
You can sign
in the designated space at the bottom.

00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:41.658
The moment you sign,

00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:44.285
20 billion won will be transferred
immediately to your account.

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:46.830
This offer is valid until 6 p.m. today.

00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:51.501
You have 18 minutes left.

00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:57.757
This is the only way.

00:36:57.841 --> 00:37:00.844
With 20 billion won,
we can clear not only your debt

00:37:00.927 --> 00:37:04.472
but also Sang-jun's, Geon-taek's,
and Seung-nam's.

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:06.099
You can't let your family

00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:08.643
lose their home and end up on the streets.

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:12.147
We trusted you and even brought in
loan shark money for the research.

00:37:12.772 --> 00:37:14.274
If Hynic Core cuts us loose too,

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.735
we're done for.

00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:24.701
Are you sure if I just sign,

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:28.538
the plan to lay off Hynic Core employees
will be withdrawn?

00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:30.749
Yes.

00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:33.418
You already checked
the contract several times.

00:37:42.552 --> 00:37:44.304
Only authorized personnel
are allowed in here.

00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:45.597
Move aside.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.475
A contract formed
under such coercion is legally void.

00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:49.726
That's not my concern.

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.312
I'm simply following orders
to not let anyone in.

00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:55.273
Hynic Core Inc.

00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:57.400
isn't just a workplace.

00:37:58.026 --> 00:38:00.153
It's a legacy shaped
by the hard work, passion,

00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.907
and youth of each and every employee.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.453
Please allow my employees
to continue working.

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:11.164
Yes, I give you my word.

00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:15.502
Mr. Lee,

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.797
it's time for you to make a decision.

00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:24.761
PARTY B, ASSIGNOR LEE SEONG-BIN

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.354
Ms. Kwon!

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:38.858
What?

00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:40.485
Get out of the way, you thugs!

00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:41.820
Mr. Lee Seong-bin!

00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:43.321
- Seong-bin!
- Mr. Lee!

00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:45.740
Don't touch me! I'll sue you!

00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:47.075
Let go of me!

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.284
Out of my way!

00:38:48.368 --> 00:38:49.410
Let go of me!

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.665
- Seong-bin!
- Mr. Lee!

00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:56.125
How did you…

00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:57.836
You damn snitch!

00:38:59.254 --> 00:39:00.588
How can you side with Optalyn?

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.423
What's the matter with you?

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:04.425
Don't sign that, Seong-bin.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:05.844
Get them out now!

00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:07.720
What do you think you're doing?

00:39:07.804 --> 00:39:08.972
Mr. Lee.

00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:10.932
This is unacceptable.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:16.688
You have less than ten minutes.

00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:20.400
The offer of 20 billion won will be
automatically withdrawn after 6 p.m.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.155
Hang on.

00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:28.324
Give me a minute.

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.665
I'm backed into a corner.

00:39:35.748 --> 00:39:38.001
My house has already been auctioned off,

00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:40.003
and you, Seung-nam,

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.881
and the others even took out
private loans because of me.

00:39:42.964 --> 00:39:45.091
That's not on you.

00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.260
Hynic Core isn't yours alone.

00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:50.513
We invested because we trusted
the technology and the company.

00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.223
That decision was ours to make.

00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:54.475
Why would you
take responsibility for that?

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:55.643
Mr. Lee.

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.854
This isn't right.

00:39:57.937 --> 00:39:59.230
Mr. Lee.

00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:02.734
Give us the chance to correct this.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.537
I'm sorry,

00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:17.624
but I won't sign the deal.

00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:18.833
Mr. Lee!

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:22.003
Mr. Ban, is this how you handle things?

00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:24.047
File the Bluestone complaint

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.424
and charge everyone involved with fraud.

00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:27.508
Okay.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.177
Sir.

00:40:31.804 --> 00:40:35.850
Why don't we find a way
for everyone to survive?

00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:47.862
We can simply take this to court.

00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:50.448
I'm sure you'll win.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.951
But debt collection is another matter.

00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:56.746
Bluestone has already distributed
120 billion won to the beneficiaries,

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:58.790
so there's no money in the fund.

00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:00.375
Even if the court puts liability

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.585
on the asset management company
or Mr. Ban,

00:41:02.669 --> 00:41:03.836
they have no ability to pay.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.507
Which means you'll have nothing to gain
even if you win the lawsuit.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.591
You know that.

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.387
Sell Hynic Core

00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:15.431
back to Bluestone for 120 billion won.

00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:19.060
I will make sure Bluestone
can return the 120 billion won.

00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:23.231
We've made moves based on our trust
in Hynic Core's technology.

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.816
Without it,

00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:28.486
recovering the 120 billion would
still leave us with significant losses.

00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:38.162
I want any evidence
related to Mr. Ko Seung-cheol.

00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:41.374
What will you do with that?

00:41:41.457 --> 00:41:43.126
Are you going to kick him out of Yullim?

00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:44.252
Yes.

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:48.089
We'll propose his dismissal
for violating the partnership agreement.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.507
And

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.261
we'll make sure he can never commit
such modern-day treachery again.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.517
You honestly believe greenhorns like you

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.894
could even lay a finger on Mr. Ko?

00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.522
There's a whole faction behind Mr. Ko.

00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:06.774
Nurtured protégés like myself

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:10.361
and high-ranking executives
brought up by the kingmaker Ko Seung-cheol

00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:14.657
are spread across the legal,
financial, and political worlds.

00:42:15.158 --> 00:42:18.077
I'll try laying my finger on him, then.

00:42:18.745 --> 00:42:21.122
Mr. Lee Seong-bin
will complete the technology

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:25.376
and grant Optalyn
an exclusive license to use it.

00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:28.671
Does that mean you'll grant usage rights

00:42:28.755 --> 00:42:30.882
but keep the technology itself?

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.718
Yes, the source code
will remain a black box

00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:35.386
and will be provided in AIP format.

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:37.472
That's the condition.

00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:40.099
Encryption
and reverse-engineering prevention.

00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:42.852
We'll get back to you
on the license royalty.

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:47.273
What if we refuse?

00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:50.359
We've secured evidence
with Ha Du-sik's help.

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:53.279
That's more than enough

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.907
to lay my finger on him.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:00.495
We just want more solid proof. That's it.

00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:01.871
Give me…

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.416
that proof.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.085
Without Mr. Lee Seong-bin,

00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:10.379
the technology can neither
be perfected nor realized.

00:43:11.047 --> 00:43:12.924
Even if you win the lawsuit,

00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.885
failing to collect will cost you billions.

00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.597
And if you lose the chance
to capture the market with the technology,

00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:21.516
the loss will be even greater.

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:26.896
This offer is only valid here and now.

00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:33.402
Along with Mr. Ko's share of the profits,
I will persuade the other beneficiaries

00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:35.780
to return the 120 billion won to Optalyn.

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:39.117
We'll return Hynic Core
to its original shareholders

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.160
once our 15 billion-won investment

00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:43.746
is repaid in full with interest.

00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:49.585
The numbers still don't add up.

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:55.049
Let me add one more thing.

00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:10.273
Okay. We'll take the deal.

00:44:24.704 --> 00:44:25.663
Hello.

00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:26.998
Name for the reservation?

00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:28.249
Heart Logic.

00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:31.627
Yes, your party is already here.

00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:32.712
Please follow me.

00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:39.927
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:47.518
Hello.

00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:51.522
What?

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.900
What are you doing here?

00:44:53.983 --> 00:44:57.695
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.366
No way. Heart Logic?

00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:03.993
Don't tell me

00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:07.997
this is what I think it is.

00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:10.082
I think it is.

00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:22.678
Hello.

00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:25.264
There's a lady in front of me
who's 11 years younger than me

00:45:25.348 --> 00:45:27.558
and has never been married.

00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:29.560
I was looking
for someone closer to my age

00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:31.520
who's also been through a divorce.

00:45:32.146 --> 00:45:35.483
Our AI analyzes your stated preferences
and your actual compatibility,

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:39.946
then suggests the most balanced match.

00:45:40.029 --> 00:45:42.073
<i>According to our AI's recommendation,</i>

00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:45.993
<i>you're a perfect match.</i>
<i>That's why we matched you two.</i>

00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:47.912
We're canceling today's arrangement.

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:50.081
If this happens again,
I'll withdraw my membership.

00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:52.541
<i>It must have caught you off guard</i>

00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:55.962
<i>to be matched with someone younger</i>
<i>who hasn't been divorced.</i>

00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:58.589
<i>Going forward, we'll prioritize</i>
<i>your individual preferences</i>

00:45:58.673 --> 00:46:01.467
<i>over the AI's analysis.</i>

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.470
<i>For today, I hope you can enjoy your meal</i>

00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:07.932
<i>and make the most of your time together.</i>

00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:10.393
No, I'd rather not.

00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:11.352
Bye.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.571
Hello.

00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:29.412
No.

00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:35.126
I actually think
he and I are a great match.

00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:39.714
I even bought new clothes
and went to the hair salon to prepare.

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:41.882
And this place is a real gem for dining.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.219
Yes. Okay.

00:46:46.178 --> 00:46:48.014
Would you like to order?

00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:49.557
Could you give us a moment?

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.560
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:53.769
I'll head out.

00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:55.896
Enjoy the meal. It's on me.

00:46:56.689 --> 00:46:58.399
Eat with me.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:46:59.775
Their food is really good.

00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:02.278
I'm sure you haven't eaten.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.363
I'm good.

00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:10.244
Can I order for one person?

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.664
I'm sorry, but we can only take orders
for two or more people.

00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:18.419
Then I'll order for two.

00:47:19.253 --> 00:47:22.548
I'm sorry, we don't seat solo diners here
since this is a central spot.

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.801
Is it okay if I move you to the bar?

00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:28.304
We'll order for two.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.556
Okay.

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.767
Why don't you like me?

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:35.186
I never said that.
I said we're not a good match.

00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:36.312
Why not?

00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:39.440
You're my junior colleague,

00:47:39.982 --> 00:47:42.443
you're a lot younger than me,
and you've never been married.

00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:47.156
I didn't expect
it would be a disadvantage.

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:48.991
It's not about advantages
or disadvantages.

00:47:49.075 --> 00:47:52.203
So you're saying I'm overqualified.

00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:55.748
"Kang Hyo-min is overqualified
for her date, Yoon Seok-hoon."

00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:59.835
It's just one date, not a wedding.

00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:01.587
Just be my date tonight.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.340
You've already cleared your schedule
for this anyway.

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:06.926
What should we do after?

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:08.844
Do we have to do something after dinner?

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:10.596
Seok-hoon…

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.723
Seok-hoon?

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.934
You're my date tonight.

00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:17.853
I can't keep addressing you as Mr. Yoon.

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:23.859
Anyway, you'll pay
for the dinner, won't you?

00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:25.653
Yes.

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:28.406
I can't mooch off you for dinner

00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:30.950
and not even buy you a cup of coffee.

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:32.201
I'm okay with that.

00:48:32.284 --> 00:48:33.452
I'm not.

00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:40.292
But the weather is a bit too nice
for just a cup of coffee.

00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:44.964
How about a walk in the park and a beer?

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:49.677
You smiled.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.928
It's a date.

00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:56.892
That's why you're going on blind dates.

00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:01.063
So basically,

00:49:01.147 --> 00:49:06.152
she should be a divorcée
in her late thirties who's into dogs.

00:49:06.235 --> 00:49:07.403
Well,

00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:11.449
I don't need my life partner
to fit a specific mold.

00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:15.953
I just think it would be easier
if she and I had similar backgrounds.

00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:19.081
"Life partner."

00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:22.042
I like that term.

00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:25.504
I think marriage is difficult.

00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:28.716
Loving someone
isn't reason enough to get married,

00:49:29.383 --> 00:49:31.969
and getting married
doesn't guarantee that love will last.

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:35.014
You can't separate love from marriage,

00:49:35.097 --> 00:49:37.099
but they do feel somewhat different.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:39.727
In what way?

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:40.895
Well,

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:45.232
if love is about looking at each other,

00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:46.775
marriage is…

00:49:48.194 --> 00:49:50.529
about looking in the same direction.

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.782
That's right.

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:58.245
I liked what you said.

00:49:59.121 --> 00:50:00.039
What did I say?

00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:03.167
"Love between a couple
starts with passion,

00:50:04.168 --> 00:50:07.755
goes through reality,
and ends in solidarity."

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.091
"Losing passion

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:14.428
doesn't mean losing love."

00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:17.515
I agree with what you said too.

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.227
"Maybe marriage isn't
the culmination of love

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.979
but the process of exhausting it."

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:26.357
My dream…

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.693
was a lifelong companion,

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:33.280
walking side by side with me
toward the same goal.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.699
But in reality,

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.829
my marriage seemed
to be a process of exhausting love.

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:44.500
And sometimes…

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.630
I feel like my life is a failure.

00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:51.674
Why?

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:53.759
Because you got divorced?

00:50:55.427 --> 00:50:56.303
Yes.

00:50:57.096 --> 00:50:58.639
I don't think so.

00:50:59.807 --> 00:51:02.893
Some loves are epic tales,

00:51:02.977 --> 00:51:06.063
and some are short stories.

00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:10.442
Just because you wrote a short story
doesn't mean it's a failure.

00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:15.155
Is that so?

00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:16.782
Yes.

00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:20.119
It's not a failure.

00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:23.163
It just means one book has ended.

00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:27.126
You need to write another one.

00:51:27.793 --> 00:51:28.877
One with passionate romance.

00:51:31.005 --> 00:51:32.006
Right.

00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:38.345
- What?
- I think my heel's wobbly.

00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:40.139
Should we stop walking?

00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:42.057
- Should we go home?
- No.

00:51:44.852 --> 00:51:46.478
Let's walk just a little more.

00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:48.397
The weather's nice.

00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:52.735
Here.

00:52:05.706 --> 00:52:08.626
By the way, did you change your cologne?

00:52:10.919 --> 00:52:11.879
Yes.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.839
Why?

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.094
To write a new story.

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:25.893
Mr. Yoon was there?

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.269
Yes.

00:52:27.853 --> 00:52:28.729
How did that happen?

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.522
How was it?
Did you both leave right away?

00:52:30.606 --> 00:52:32.983
You said you had dinner.
Did you have dinner with him?

00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:35.944
Tell us in detail.
Don't leave anything out.

00:52:37.196 --> 00:52:41.867
We were both shocked at first,

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.994
but I asked him to continue our date.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.038
He was going to leave,

00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:49.208
but we ended up having dinner
and even going on a walk together.

00:52:50.876 --> 00:52:53.212
I held… his arm.

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.172
- His arm?
- His arm?

00:52:55.255 --> 00:52:56.507
How was it?

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.927
- It was good.
- What was good?

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.679
We consoled

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:04.181
each other.

00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:08.143
Oh boy. They say consolation
is the seed of love.

00:53:08.227 --> 00:53:09.269
Love?

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:11.605
Hey, he's my boss. How disrespectful!

00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:13.524
That's not what your face is saying.

00:53:14.274 --> 00:53:17.069
Didn't you tell us
that you don't need love?

00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:19.947
You said we're all you need.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.740
Do you still buy that?

00:53:21.824 --> 00:53:24.576
That's what we say after fighting
or breaking up with our boyfriends.

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:27.246
- Accept it.
- Accept what?

00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:30.332
We always come second to each other.

00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:32.584
No way.

00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:34.128
Is that a bad thing?

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.796
I like it.

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.047
Being second?

00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:38.507
Yes. Look.

00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:43.011
For us, our boyfriends, family,
or future husband and children

00:53:43.095 --> 00:53:44.888
will inevitably come first.

00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:47.141
But those priorities aren't perfect.

00:53:47.224 --> 00:53:50.602
They hurt us and disappoint us.

00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:53.021
Sometimes, they betray us.

00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:55.149
But that's fine

00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:58.777
because we always have
our second priorities to support us.

00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:02.573
We're each other's safeguard,
standing just a step behind.

00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:03.532
That's us.

00:54:05.451 --> 00:54:06.493
That's touching.

00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:08.912
You're right.

00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:13.083
I can love again
and go through all the ups and downs

00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:17.755
because you're right behind me.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.593
- Come on.
- Jeez.

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:23.844
I love you.

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:24.887
I don't.

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.726
- I love you.
- Stop it.

00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:32.352
That's enough.

00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:42.529
So basically,

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.365
to oust Mr. Ko Seung-cheol,

00:54:46.241 --> 00:54:48.118
you need my vote.

00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:49.995
That's right.

00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:04.343
Mr. Kim,

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:08.597
this is about Yullim's honor
and very existence.

00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:13.644
I understand.

00:55:16.605 --> 00:55:18.106
Give me some time to think.

00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:30.035
All right.

00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:33.247
Take your time and let me know.

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:38.043
Don't do anything until I make a decision.

00:55:38.752 --> 00:55:40.754
Yes, sir.

00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:50.597
Gosh.

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:53.267
It's been a while.

00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:55.769
Back when I was out doing sales,

00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:58.647
I'd just down my drink
without a moment to savor it.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.650
We drank like fish back then.

00:56:03.694 --> 00:56:05.112
Do you remember?

00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:08.699
When we were in sales, we drank so much

00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:12.119
that all three of us, Myeong-jin included,
were taken to the hospital.

00:56:13.871 --> 00:56:14.997
I remember that.

00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:16.915
My goodness.

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:21.044
Back then, law firms were like lobbyists,
hiring ex-officials

00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:24.548
from the Fair Trade Commission
and the Financial Supervisory Service

00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:28.093
to reduce corporate fines
and adjust the level of sanctions.

00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:30.345
That's what we did back then.

00:56:30.429 --> 00:56:33.432
Nowadays, we'd be in big trouble
if we did that.

00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:35.142
There are things

00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.728
that worked back then but no longer work.

00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:44.776
Go on, then.

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:47.487
Sorry?

00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:51.158
You've been following me around for days,
unable to get it off your chest.

00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:53.035
Well…

00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:54.328
What is it?

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.877
Did Kwon Na-yeon talk to you?

00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:05.881
Yes.

00:57:09.343 --> 00:57:10.510
Do you remember

00:57:11.803 --> 00:57:14.932
what you told me
when we first started Yullim?

00:57:15.015 --> 00:57:16.433
What did I say?

00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:18.435
When I asked you

00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:22.981
why you were giving me so many shares
if I hadn't really done much,

00:57:24.733 --> 00:57:25.901
you said,

00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:27.819
"Your shares will be

00:57:27.903 --> 00:57:30.155
the last counterbalance
to protect Yullim."

00:57:31.823 --> 00:57:32.783
Did I say that?

00:57:33.992 --> 00:57:36.244
I didn't understand
what it meant back then,

00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:38.121
but now I do.

00:57:38.956 --> 00:57:42.709
You kept me as a safeguard

00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:46.463
in case you ever became
corrupted in the future.

00:57:46.546 --> 00:57:48.757
You could have arranged
the share structure

00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:51.760
so that no one could expel you.

00:57:52.678 --> 00:57:55.222
But instead, you put a check on yourself.

00:57:55.847 --> 00:57:59.351
You chose me as the final safeguard

00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:03.271
to prevent your whims or corruption

00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:05.565
from bringing Yullim down.

00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:11.405
Do you think
you're that important to the firm?

00:58:12.531 --> 00:58:13.407
Gosh.

00:58:15.575 --> 00:58:17.160
You're right.

00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:21.832
The reason I chose you

00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:25.919
was because I believed
you would always make

00:58:27.713 --> 00:58:30.674
selfless decisions for the sake of Yullim.

00:58:34.302 --> 00:58:36.680
I know I'm not that great a lawyer.

00:58:39.975 --> 00:58:42.978
But I do believe I have the eye
to recognize talented people,

00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:46.857
as well as the generosity
and wisdom to nurture them.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.571
I believe that collection of talents
will become Yullim's backbone,

00:58:52.654 --> 00:58:55.615
and the fortress they build

00:58:56.241 --> 00:58:58.285
will stand on a solid foundation,

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.038
not on shifting sand.

00:59:03.999 --> 00:59:05.333
The name "Yullim" was made

00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:09.379
by taking a character from my own name.

00:59:10.338 --> 00:59:12.549
Based on the loyalty you instilled in me,

00:59:14.259 --> 00:59:15.927
I will carry out the mission

00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:19.514
that your past self left me.

00:59:21.433 --> 00:59:23.226
Even if it goes against you now.

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:26.521
This is not a discussion.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.276
It's a notice.

00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:54.382
Is that Hyo-min?

00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.095
What are you doing here?

00:59:58.637 --> 00:59:59.805
Hi, Hyo-min.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:01.932
I haven't seen that outfit before.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.350
How chic.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.727
Cherry must be hungry.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.187
I should feed her.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:09.856
Come in.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:16.905
- We're home, Cherry.
- My goodness.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.158
Have you eaten yet?

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:24.579
Have you eaten yet?

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.082
Right. Food.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.210
No.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:34.464
Let me quickly feed Cherry,
and then we should eat too.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:37.676
It's so nice to see you
unexpectedly like this.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:39.970
Go wash your hands.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.013
You should get changed too, Honey.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.932
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:44.975
Take a seat.

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.147
Mom…

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:55.735
Auntie.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:08.623
I'm probably surprising you
by dropping in unannounced.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.964
How can you talk?

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.924
Can you hear me?

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:20.260
I…

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.763
can read lips.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.235
FOR CHERRY

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:42.699
Thank you.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:47.287
Hyo-ju.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:02:00.508
Can I… see you again?

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.640
I learned sign language

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:11.519
to talk to you in case I saw you.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.986
I'm… sorry.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.741
I've always felt bad.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:29.996
My daughter.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.042
I'm sorry.

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:39.464
This whole time I couldn't visit

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:41.633
because I thought
it might make you feel bad,

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:46.054
and that is why I came today.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:52.477
I've been happy. I am happy.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.438
And I will stay happy.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.148
Okay.

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.934
The reason we're here is not pleasant,
so let's get straight to the point.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:34.519
You're proposing my dismissal?

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:35.854
Yes, I am.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.316
Ms. Kwon, can't you read the room?

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:42.777
Counting Shin Myeong-jin, Ko Seung-cheol,
Kim Yul-seong, Ko Tae-seop,

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:47.240
Choi Hui-cheol, and my own shares,
we surpass the majority.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.742
No matter what you do,

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.411
the motion to dismiss Mr. Ko can't pass.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.746
Still, I'll give it a go.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.664
Who knows?

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:58.335
Someone you thought was on your side
might support the dismissal.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.627
My gosh.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.048
Let's hear your terms first.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:07.469
You appointed me as the head,
so let me do my job.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.387
During my three-year term,

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.931
place the voting rights
of Mr. Shin Myeong-jin

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:15.101
and your own in my trust.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.561
And

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:21.691
never try to oust me again

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.069
through schemes.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:25.278
Above all,

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:29.616
drop the dirty trick of using a young man

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.285
to fabricate a scandal.

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:34.454
A young man?

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.247
That's…

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.091
I understand. Let's do it.

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:48.426
- Mr. Ko.
- Get me the papers.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.678
- I'll sign them.
- Why don't you take some time?

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:52.806
You may leave, Mr. Ha.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.432
But Mr. Ko--

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.935
Yes, sir.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.239
You joined Yullim

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:14.953
when we had fewer than 30 attorneys,

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.454
didn't you?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:17.455
Yes.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.708
You interviewed me yourself.

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:23.294
I remember that day clearly.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:26.631
You looked so sharp
that I knew you'd be good at your job.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.102
Mr. Kim Yul-seong came to me.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:44.023
For a moment, I'd forgotten

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:46.734
what Yullim means to me.

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:53.366
I'm not stepping down
because you're pressuring me.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.911
It's because of my love for Yullim.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.124
Yullim is like my own child.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.668
I've poured everything I have into it.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.507
But these days,

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.178
I feel that we need a fresh change

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:17.474
because sticking to the old ways
won't get us anywhere.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.479
So I'm giving you a chance

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.024
to see if you can make a change.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.567
Yes, Mr. Ko.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:32.447
Some use the law as a weapon,

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:36.242
and others use it as a tool.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.165
What is the difference between the two?

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.249
I'm not sure.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:46.336
The former tries to uphold the law,

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:49.464
while the latter tries to rule over it.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:53.885
I am the latter, and you are the former.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:07:00.308
Unfortunately, the former
has never once beaten the latter.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.268
With all due respect,

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.563
exploiting loopholes in the law

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.983
to gain profit
and manipulate it like you do

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.277
is not the path I intend to take.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.490
I will use the law as a weapon

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.284
to build a fair system.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:20.745
You see,

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:24.123
I thought the same when I was your age.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.960
I believed that skill alone
would be enough to succeed.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:30.922
But in reality, it's never that simple.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:35.593
I'll face reality myself
and make my own judgment.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:37.595
Suit yourself.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.057
Just don't break.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:46.062
True strength lies in the flexibility

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.774
to bend at times rather than snap.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.151
In that sense,

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:56.239
make good use of Mr. Yoon.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:08:00.201
For someone like you,
he could prove invaluable.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:04.414
Thank you for the advice.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.167
I have another engagement now.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:11.170
Right. I'll get going, then.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.262
Please…

01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:25.893
take good care of Yullim.

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:31.524
I will, Mr. Ko.

01:08:49.083 --> 01:08:50.418
You did well.

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:51.878
Let's do this right.

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:03.848
I will now deliver the verdict.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:05.933
From the outset,

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:08.686
the plaintiff, Ko Min-chan,
and the defendant, Park Hyeon-yeong,

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:14.192
lacked any intent
for physical or emotional union,

01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:19.364
and it has since been maintained
without the substance of a marriage.

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:23.159
In addition, the plaintiff
has unequivocally expressed

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:25.161
the impossibility
of continuing the marriage,

01:09:25.244 --> 01:09:27.914
and the defendant's
genuine intent to reconcile

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.668
cannot be recognized.
Taking these circumstances into account,

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:35.254
the court finds that this matter falls

01:09:35.922 --> 01:09:39.008
within Article 840,
Paragraph 6 of the Civil Act,

01:09:39.092 --> 01:09:42.178
a serious cause making it
difficult to continue the marriage,

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.681
and hereby grants the plaintiff's claim

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.225
for divorce.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:52.397
As someone who has handled
divorce cases for a long time,

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.816
I will add just one remark.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.653
Love is not perfect,

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:04.283
and marriage is the process
of enduring that imperfect love together.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:09.330
That process can be difficult
and can fail.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.083
And sometimes divorce
is chosen as a result.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.628
However, if we exclude love
from the very beginning

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.130
just because it is difficult,

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:22.802
we lose the most essential value
in the journey of marriage.

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:27.724
Although the marital relationship
will come to an end,

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:31.686
I hope that the sincerity
and responsibility that existed within it

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.521
will remain for a long time.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.316
This concludes the court's ruling.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.804
You held up well.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:13.019
This ruling views love
as the essence of marriage,

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:16.773
but I believe responsibility
can also be its essence.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.859
I hope you understand
that this outcome does not negate

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:22.570
your responsibility as a parent

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:25.948
nor the respect and sincerity
contained within it.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.492
I don't think that way.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:28.743
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:31.120
Thank you, Ms. Kang.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:32.747
Thank you.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.254
I'll go…

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.216
and pick up Min.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.677
If you have time…

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:49.597
Gosh.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.141
Never mind.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:54.227
I'll get going.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.561
I'll join you.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:57.563
Let's have dinner too.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.440
Really?

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:00.650
Can you make time?

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.778
Then let's have dinner together,
the three of us.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.738
We eat out too often these days.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.281
You do it often as well.

01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:09.826
What if Min's eczema flares up again?

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:12.995
I found a temple cuisine place
that only uses organic ingredients.

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.622
No additives, and the seasoning's light.

01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:16.457
Really? Where?

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.047
Are you okay?

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.008
Don't be nervous.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:27.385
- I'm not.
- Really?

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.346
Why am I getting nervous?

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:32.932
- I am too.
- Right?

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.934
She already said yes, right?

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.477
It's just a formality, right?

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.313
- No.
- What?

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:41.107
So she could say no?

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:43.568
Yes.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.695
This is crazy.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:48.030
What made you so confident to invite us?

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.741
Do you know how living together
is different from marriage?

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:53.828
What is it?

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:56.581
Living together is an agreement
between two people,

01:12:56.664 --> 01:13:00.501
but marriage is declaring that agreement
to family, friends, and the world.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.713
So even a marriage proposal
needs witnesses.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.048
Especially if someone like
Mr. Yoon is here.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:07.925
It carries more weight.

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.510
You have a point.

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:13.598
Hyo-min said she'd cover
Min-jeon's eyes as they walk in,

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:16.475
so start the music
as soon as Min-jeong shows up.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:17.476
Good.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:19.937
Here they come.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:21.480
Okay!

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.150
I've never felt anything like this before.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.110
Be careful.

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:28.779
The ground is lumpy.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:29.822
Be careful.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:32.408
To the right.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.163
- How much longer?
- You're almost there.

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:40.374
- What is this?
- Be careful.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:43.127
- You can stand here.
- Here?

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.174
Can I open my eyes?

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.096
What's with the clapping?

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:56.849
What's all this?

01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.268
Min-jeong.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:01.646
Hi.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:04.315
I jotted down

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.859
a few words yesterday

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.071
for this very moment.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:13.699
A vow of my love to you, my darling.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:15.493
"My darling"?

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:19.914
VOW OF LOVE

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:23.626
What are you doing?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.586
Come on.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:31.550
"Vow of Love."

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.552
"With you, I will cherish

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:37.306
the first spark of our love
even as time goes by,

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:41.936
and I will uphold
my respect and trust in you."

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.939
"May today's love carry into tomorrow,

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:49.986
and may tomorrow's love
deepen into eternity."

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.989
"And the name of that eternity…"

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.918
Now that I'm reading it out loud,

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.754
it's a bit weird.

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:14.093
It all sounds a bit too perfect.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:18.639
So it doesn't sound like my own words.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:20.141
Right?

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:21.100
A little bit.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.811
I keep saying I love you

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.899
and promising
that my love will last forever,

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:31.277
but the truth is…

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:37.158
I'm not even sure
I know what love really is.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.829
I guess it makes sense.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:43.873
After all,

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.459
no one tells us

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.336
how we're supposed to love each other.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:52.757
So it seems

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.843
we only learn what love is

01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:58.929
after being hurt,

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.477
and we realize its value
only after losing it.

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.189
That's how, step by step,

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:10.483
we've come…

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.028
to understand love.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.199
So to me, love feels like

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.034
a journey of constant questioning,

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.121
reflection, and experiences

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.998
as I search

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.584
for my own answer.

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.169
And I want to make…

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.340
that journey with you.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:39.428
I won't vow
that my love will last forever,

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.849
as I wrote it down.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:48.646
But there's one promise
I truly want to make.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.610
I want to go with you to the very end,

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:58.072
to see what lies beyond this vow of love.

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:01.033
I will be the husband

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.619
who stands by your side,

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.373
who watches us grow
and change beyond our youth

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.083
and who protects you

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:12.044
until the very end.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:16.674
Here.

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:22.680
I…

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.100
I got quite a big ring.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.524
Will you marry me?

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.847
Do you walk here often?

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:30.015
Yes.

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:33.310
When I have things on my mind.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:37.231
What was on your mind today?

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:40.109
I kept thinking about
what the judge said today.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:43.612
I did too.

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:45.447
Having loved before,

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:48.534
I know how imperfect love can be.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.327
I've been hurt.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:53.163
And I've failed.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:57.126
So I thought maybe it would be wiser

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.461
to just meet someone who's a good match

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.299
and live a steady, uneventful life

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:05.551
rather than chase love.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:08.137
So that's why you chose
a matchmaking agency.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.976
Still, you had a good time
with me, didn't you?

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.146
It wasn't bad.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.273
I didn't expect to feel comforted.

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.275
See? I told you it would be good.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.325
But it's not just you.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:32.202
I thought the same way too.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.289
I thought if I loved less, I'd hurt less.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:37.624
So I thought

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:40.669
that everything might be easier

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:43.881
if I set love aside
and simply found an adequate match,

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:48.052
But what the judge said
really hit me to the core.

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:50.971
In trying to take the easy way,

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:53.557
I could end up ignoring
the very essence of it all.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:55.768
Yes.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:03.442
But at the same time,
I understood what you said

01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:07.696
about the essence of marriage
being responsibility.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.281
I guess both are necessary.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.617
Both love and responsibility.

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.537
But neither is easy.

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:18.457
I guess that's why people get divorced.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.250
Divorce isn't the end, after all.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.586
Especially this last case we had.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:23.712
Right.

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:27.174
Ms. Park Hyeon-yeong's husband
probably wanted a divorce

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.009
not to end the relationship

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:32.721
but to start over in a new form.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.849
I guess divorce isn't a finish line

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.811
but a new starting line.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.358
I may have lost the trial,
but that was nice.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.318
What do you mean?

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:49.363
Regardless of the outcome,

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.241
I feel like I've learned
about love in the courtroom.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.701
The judge's words resonated with me,

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:59.415
and Mr. Lee's proposal
was the perfect ending.

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:01.166
You were on the verge of crying.

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:04.211
"I don't know

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:07.131
what lies beyond the vow of love."

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:12.302
When I heard that,
something welled up inside me.

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:15.180
Honestly, I even get choked up
sometimes at weddings.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.433
And yet you said all that in court?

01:22:18.725 --> 01:22:21.562
Oh, was that you speaking as a lawyer?

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:24.898
It was fifty-fifty.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:32.197
Like Mr. Lee said,
I'm not sure if I know what love is.

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:39.496
Still, I've learned a lot
from handling cases at Yullim,

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.497
like I did today.

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:41.707
What did you learn?

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:43.083
About love?

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.544
Yes. About love.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.476
<i>The love between a man and a woman.</i>

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:03.854
- Well done.
- Thank you.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:05.731
Thank you.

01:23:17.451 --> 01:23:20.370
<i>The love of parents for their children.</i>

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:35.552
<i>The love of children for their parents.</i>

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:48.398
<i>And</i>

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:51.652
<i>the love between spouses.</i>

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.532
I'm sorry.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.392
<i>Even the love we show to others.</i>

01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:31.191
Thank you for reminding me
that love takes many forms

01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:34.319
and for teaching me

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:38.282
how to understand and heal the wounds

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.620
that come with it.

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:49.876
But I still don't really know

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.380
what love truly is.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.511
What do you think love is?

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.434
Well…

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.356
To me, love is…

01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:52.397
BEYOND THE BAR
