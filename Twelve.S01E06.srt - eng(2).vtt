00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.517
{\an8}

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:11.196
TWELVE

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.395
I lost track of it again.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.483
It's definitely nearby.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.736
It couldn't have gotten far.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.531
Let's split up and search.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.450
- I'll go this way.
- Sure.

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.402
Mirr, it's me.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.863
- You startled me.
- Geez, Kangji.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.453
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.916
- It escaped us, didn't it?
- I wouldn't be here if it didn't.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.419
I bet we scared it off.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.799
What is it?

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:37.968
Isn't it weird?

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.429
- What do you mean?
- The evil spirits.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.306
They used to come out only at night,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.725
but now they show up at any hour.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.061
There's more of them too.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.938
Don't worry too much.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.773
Let's come back with the others tomorrow.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.401
Sure.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.154
Will you stay seated there?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.781
Let's go. We should go back
and join the others.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.242
Sure. Go ahead without me.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:04.703
On my own?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.371
Why? What about you?

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.713
Mirr, don't tell me…

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.299
Are you still seeing him?

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.470
We told you to end it.
Until when--

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.972
This is my business. I'll handle it.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.141
This isn't something you can handle alone.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.061
What will you tell the others
and what if Taesan and Marok find out?

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:34.441
Mirr.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.693
Be wise about this.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.780
If you violate the rules
and keep seeing him,

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:43.033
Ogwi might have to pay a big price.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.452
You and Ogwi.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.122
I wish you'd choose
what's best for each other.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.170
This will be the last time
I turn a blind eye.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.893
Mirr.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.813
Don't forget this. Ogwi isn't like us.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.731
He's human,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.693
and we were created to protect humans.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:41.967
TWELVE

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.689
If it gets dangerous,

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.191
just run. I'll handle them.

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:00.360
Hey,

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.530
are you belittling me
or looking out for me?

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:07.576
You know full well I'm the only one
whose powers aren't sealed.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.623
I've got this.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.220
You puny brat.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.433
Way to go.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.840
Goodness.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.428
Uh-huh.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:37.767
Samin, did you take my soul stone?

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.609
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.197
I have a choice to make.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.159
One that brings me pleasure.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.788
Who should I kill first?

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.112
Mirr.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:55.864
Mirr, wake up.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:57.740
Mirr?

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.450
Mirr!

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:06.249
Ogwi, you.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:10.128
Your memories are back.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:15.884
How does it feel

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.679
to be fully conscious yet unable to move?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.809
Though I was trapped
for thousands of years,

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.812
I could never get used to it.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.204
Why did you have me sealed back then?

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.875
That wasn't what I planned.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.503
It was God's will.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:34.629
I see.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.550
The same God
who has ignored me my whole life?

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.804
How about I forsake you the same way?

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.809
Like the time I lost
in thousands of years of captivity

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.436
and the memories that were erased,

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.189
you will face death.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:32.640
MAROK
INCOMING CALL

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.433
Chief, Marok's calling.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:40.148
Hello? Old man!

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.691
Marok!

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.366
Taesan.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:55.037
Well, I…

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.081
It hurts a lot.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.709
Old man, what happened?

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:00.918
You…

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.754
are going to listen to me.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.216
Samin…

00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:11.053
seems to have acquired Haetae's powers.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.181
Now,

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.768
he will control humans as he pleases.

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.062
That's why

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.190
you must

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.109
open the Hellmouth, Taesan.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.361
Do you hear me?

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.323
A world without humans

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:32.617
will be Hell…

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.828
stripped of any future.

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:37.496
Hold on.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.623
Also,

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.878
Ogwi took Mirr away.

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.088
You must

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.341
find her.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:50.968
If Samin gets his hands

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.346
on the Dragon Soul

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:56.933
within Mirr too,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.769
you won't be able to handle him

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.648
even if you guys get your powers back.

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:04.732
Do you hear me?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.400
I got it, old man.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:08.486
I'll get Mirr back, whatever it takes.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.364
I'm on my way, so hang in there.

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:12.949
Got it, old man?

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.075
I…

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.994
wanted to fulfill my duties

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.539
as your guardian until the very end.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:25.002
I'm sorry to leave you
with this burden, Taesan.

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:28.339
Taesan,

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.132
I…

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.303
The money…

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.139
The money I borrowed from you.

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.936
I'm afraid I can't pay you back.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.691
Old man, you will pay me back!

00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:48.276
Survive and pay me back.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.860
Pull yourself together!

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.070
Forgive me…

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.115
for always…

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:57.785
leaning and depending on you.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.582
I'm sorry.

00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:06.460
Taesan…

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:09.171
I'm sorry.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.217
I'm sorry.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.471
Old man?

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:19.765
Old man!

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:23.436
Old man!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.816
Old man!

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.319
Old man…

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.072
Wonseung.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.535
We must hurry. Step on it.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:40.620
Got it.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:09.774
Over there.

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.762
Marok!

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:54.985
Taesan, Marok is…

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.743
Marok…

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:11.836
Old man.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.223
Chief, Marok's gone…

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.104
Old man.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:38.112
Marok.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.948
Marok!

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.389
Marok…

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.589
Marok…

00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:02.071
Marok…

00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:33.060
Marok!

00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:49.577
Marok.

00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:09.597
TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:53.390
At last, the world has returned
to how it used to be.

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.560
Humans are

00:23:57.686 --> 00:23:59.647
without a doubt special beings.

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:05.027
To honor and cherish their time together,

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:09.490
they unite in thought and strength

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:12.034
to build stone graves like this

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:15.663
for the deceased.

00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:21.001
To protect these humans…

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.297
God sent you and the other angels

00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:27.257
in human form.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.134
Eventually,

00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:31.679
as God intended, you and the angels

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:35.057
saved the human world.

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:39.812
My siblings are dead.

00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:43.732
Sacrificing our lives to protect humans…

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:48.237
Is that what God really intended?

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:55.536
Protecting humans comes with sacrifices.

00:24:57.705 --> 00:25:00.124
It is our destiny to accept such a life.

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:04.878
Taesan.

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:10.259
Do not let your siblings' deaths

00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:13.178
cause you to waver. Okay?

00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:23.022
That is one miserable destiny.

00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:14.526
{\an8}ANGEL

00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:51.605
Chief!

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:01.323
What's he thinking,
opening the Hellmouth?

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.743
It was bound to be shattered
at some point.

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:07.913
Chief…

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.055
Now,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.390
with the Hellmouth shattered,

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:36.520
evil will engulf the world.

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:38.730
We have one day

00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:41.608
to find Mirr

00:31:43.026 --> 00:31:44.986
and kill Samin and Ogwi.

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:47.280
After that,

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.034
we'll reseal the Hellmouth.

00:32:46.423 --> 00:32:48.300
For reasons still unknown,

00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:50.594
the sky has started to turn black,

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:53.263
darkening the day as though it were night.

00:32:53.346 --> 00:32:57.017
Strange fine dust continues to fall
from the sky,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.102
causing damage in surrounding areas.

00:32:59.603 --> 00:33:03.106
If you are watching this,
please take shelter indoors…

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.400
Are you kidding me?

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.903
- Move, will you?
- Come on!

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:10.780
- Who's blocking the street?
- Are you serious?

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:15.327
Who are those nutjobs?

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.870
Get out of the way.

00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:22.209
- Move.
- Move!

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.796
Get out of the way.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.965
- Move out of the street.
- Move!

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:31.259
- I have no idea what's going on.
- Move?

00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:37.641
Get out of the way.
What are you doing?

00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.066
Move, will you?

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:42.914
So, for dinner…

00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:46.418
Hey, your eyes!

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.385
What's going on? Run!

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.211
Let's go.

00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:56.477
Chief.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.971
I've hurt him enough.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.349
Haetae has turned into an evil spirit.

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.267
He must be eliminated.

00:40:36.935 --> 00:40:37.936
That is God's will.

00:41:59.892 --> 00:42:01.269
Marok!

00:42:07.483 --> 00:42:09.485
Marok, are you all right?

00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:23.666
No!
