00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:01.992
(Episode 9)

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:03.962
- No, it's not like that. - It is like that.

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.302
I didn't know you could be so manipulative.

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:10.702
Fine. I got it.

00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:13.142
Keep doing what you're doing.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.142
Will you let me off a bit,

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:19.742
Ji Eun Oh?

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:21.282
A bit?

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:23.052
I won't bother you any further.

00:00:23.052 --> 00:00:24.282
You won't.

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:26.952
What?

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:29.122
Because I quit.

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:31.292
You'll what?

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.162
I was the manager of this cafe.

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:35.992
I resign.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.332
You'll quit working here?

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:46.202
The monk must leave if the temple becomes unbearable.

00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:49.542
Don't you feel bad for me?

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:51.512
Don't you have a conscience?

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:53.582
I felt bad.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:00:59.852
But I was going to pretend I didn't.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:03.522
Because I need to survive.

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:07.522
You don't care whether I live or die.

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:12.362
Will you die?

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:17.532
If I'm around...

00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:20.772
If I'm in your space,

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:24.172
will that kill you?

00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:30.352
Save your twisted logic for Hyeon Su.

00:01:30.712 --> 00:01:32.352
And go on doing what you wish.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:35.052
I will die.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:42.132
Do you think...

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.662
I don't know how much you resent, despise,

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:48.602
and belittle me?

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:52.002
You think I don't know?

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:55.642
I feel...

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:00.882
horribly ashamed,

00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:03.512
humiliated,

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:06.822
and embarrassed.

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:10.922
But I still came here.

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:15.662
Because I needed to survive.

00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:20.132
I had no money at all,

00:02:21.332 --> 00:02:22.472
and I needed to start a business.

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:27.172
I needed some place to fall back on,

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:31.212
and this was...

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:35.682
the only place.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.022
And the person who hates me most works here.

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:47.992
That's why I went to Hyeon Su.

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:51.462
So you wouldn't be able to...

00:02:53.232 --> 00:02:54.362
turn me away.

00:02:56.832 --> 00:02:57.972
I knew that was unfair.

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:01.442
I wanted to...

00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:07.082
start over, away from you and away from everyone else.

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:09.452
I wish I could have.

00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:15.322
Pretend I'm a stranger...

00:03:17.122 --> 00:03:18.152
for just a few months.

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:21.832
I'll leave when I get my bearings.

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:34.942
You mean I have to...

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:39.012
put up with this...

00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:41.182
for two months?

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:49.352
If you quit because you can't even stand that,

00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:53.222
then I must leave.

00:03:57.562 --> 00:03:58.632
What?

00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:00.762
That's not right.

00:04:02.732 --> 00:04:04.072
I stay here while you resign?

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:07.172
I can't let that happen.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:11.212
You said you'd die if you couldn't work here.

00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:15.042
Even if I die.

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:41.542
I don't believe this.

00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:45.182
What? He'll leave if I quit?

00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:47.242
My gosh.

00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:50.752
I stay here while you resign?

00:04:52.722 --> 00:04:53.782
I can't let that happen.

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.362
He has a conscience, then?

00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:06.232
I just can't stand him.

00:05:33.192 --> 00:05:34.222
Hey.

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:36.032
I don't need help with the cleaning.

00:05:36.762 --> 00:05:38.432
I want my workspace back soon.

00:06:09.392 --> 00:06:10.392
Okay.

00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:21.202
You can stay in here now you have a peephole, right?

00:06:24.612 --> 00:06:26.812
- What? - From now on,

00:06:27.982 --> 00:06:30.582
don't go through Hyeon Su anymore.

00:06:31.282 --> 00:06:32.452
I won't have to.

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:35.652
Don't act like you know me.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:38.252
Don't say hello. Don't talk to me.

00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:41.292
Keep these three rules.

00:06:43.062 --> 00:06:44.162
Please.

00:06:50.072 --> 00:06:51.232
Can I get an answer?

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:54.772
I'll do that.

00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:58.942
We're closed today, so I can't make you coffee.

00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:02.612
Okay.

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:17.732
This wasn't the idea.

00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:07.742
No food that smells.

00:08:11.152 --> 00:08:13.522
I had ramyeon with the door open.

00:08:21.392 --> 00:08:24.762
So what? Sang Cheol goes to class?

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:29.032
He studies all day long from Monday to Friday.

00:08:29.032 --> 00:08:31.702
Yes, and I might have to go out on some Saturdays too,

00:08:31.702 --> 00:08:33.072
for a special lecture.

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:37.512
So you'll learn about electricity?

00:08:37.572 --> 00:08:38.612
Yes.

00:08:39.242 --> 00:08:42.182
I want to become an expert in that field.

00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:44.812
If I become an electrical technician...

00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:47.452
and work for a few years,

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.522
I can become an electrical engineer.

00:08:49.652 --> 00:08:51.552
- Oh, I see. - Yes.

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:54.192
That's quite something.

00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:56.532
You're going back to studying.

00:08:57.732 --> 00:09:00.302
They say we'll live to be a hundred.

00:09:00.402 --> 00:09:02.672
I have many years to live, and it pays to have a license.

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:22.922
(Teaching Certificate, Kim Da Jeong)

00:09:22.922 --> 00:09:24.392
(Licensed 2nd-grade elementary school teacher)

00:09:24.392 --> 00:09:27.092
(Public Service Card, Kim Da Jeong)

00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:34.802
One, two, three, four,

00:09:35.102 --> 00:09:37.872
five, six, seven, eight.

00:09:40.402 --> 00:09:42.512
My arms and legs still work just fine.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.882
Honey. You don't think I'll die in the next year, do you?

00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:51.612
My son who's in his 60s...

00:09:51.612 --> 00:09:53.822
is learning a new trade to make money.

00:09:55.892 --> 00:09:58.522
I won't be a parasite any longer.

00:09:59.092 --> 00:10:00.422
I'm his mom.

00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:05.132
(Part-timers needed, simple tasks)

00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:10.002
I should knock at least.

00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.502
What am I afraid of?

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:15.642
"Novices accepted, seniors welcome."

00:10:16.112 --> 00:10:17.842
That's what your notice said.

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:24.582
(Part-timers needed, simple tasks)

00:10:27.782 --> 00:10:29.492
Excuse me.

00:10:30.892 --> 00:10:32.562
So, you are looking for employees.

00:10:33.462 --> 00:10:34.622
Are you looking for a job?

00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:38.192
Yes. I'm 88 this year.

00:10:38.192 --> 00:10:40.032
Can I work here?

00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:42.432
Go ahead and tell me before I cross the threshold.

00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:43.932
Please look at me, ma'am.

00:10:45.532 --> 00:10:47.342
Open your hands like this.

00:10:51.212 --> 00:10:54.882
One, two, three, four, five. Do it.

00:10:55.782 --> 00:10:59.282
One, two, three, four, five.

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:01.752
Do you think I'm a child?

00:11:02.552 --> 00:11:04.092
It's all good. Please come on in.

00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:05.252
I'll teach you.

00:11:05.592 --> 00:11:06.622
Yes!

00:11:07.692 --> 00:11:09.192
Fold it here.

00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:10.562
And fold it in half.

00:11:10.562 --> 00:11:11.732
- Like this? - That's right.

00:11:11.732 --> 00:11:13.062
- Fold it lengthwise. - Yes.

00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:14.362
Good.

00:11:14.532 --> 00:11:16.002
You're really good at this.

00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:18.942
You're good.

00:11:19.042 --> 00:11:21.142
You will get the hang of it soon.

00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:24.742
Gosh, you're...

00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:36.522
Well... Mr. Kim.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.992
Please don't tell Da Jeong...

00:11:39.992 --> 00:11:42.192
that you saw me here.

00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:44.962
I do not want my son to find out about this.

00:11:45.192 --> 00:11:47.632
Actually, I'm keeping this a secret...

00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:50.232
from Da Jeong too.

00:11:50.472 --> 00:11:51.602
I see.

00:11:55.842 --> 00:11:59.282
I will get going, then.

00:11:59.282 --> 00:12:00.742
Are you going home?

00:12:00.742 --> 00:12:02.182
Won't you fold the envelopes?

00:12:03.652 --> 00:12:06.282
How can I do that when you're here?

00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:10.322
Then I'll quit.

00:12:10.322 --> 00:12:11.522
You should take the job.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:14.392
What? Please don't do that.

00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:17.762
You started it before I came, so I can't let you quit.

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:20.062
I just can't do that to my in-law.

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:21.632
By the way,

00:12:22.232 --> 00:12:23.832
why does it even matter?

00:12:24.502 --> 00:12:26.102
We're just here to work.

00:12:26.272 --> 00:12:27.272
What?

00:12:27.442 --> 00:12:30.842
At our age, it's not easy to find a part-time job like this.

00:12:31.242 --> 00:12:32.882
We just need to keep it a secret from our children.

00:12:34.242 --> 00:12:35.512
Our children?

00:12:36.552 --> 00:12:38.252
Sang Cheol and Da Jeong?

00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:39.252
Yes.

00:12:39.622 --> 00:12:41.922
Should we keep our distance when we're about to turn 90?

00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:43.892
Don't you agree, Ms. Jo?

00:12:44.622 --> 00:12:45.762
Let's work together.

00:12:50.992 --> 00:12:52.332
(Owa Fire and Electrical Training Academy)

00:12:52.332 --> 00:12:54.432
These are the characteristics of each generator.

00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:56.032
Including the shunt-wound electric generators...

00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:57.872
and series-wound generators I mentioned earlier,

00:12:57.872 --> 00:12:59.502
there are various types.

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:01.972
Likewise, this is the part you should memorize.

00:13:01.972 --> 00:13:03.742
You need to memorize...

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.542
the characteristics of each generator.

00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:08.342
Yes. The buttons work properly.

00:13:08.342 --> 00:13:10.552
I checked for any errors in the external and internal links.

00:13:10.552 --> 00:13:12.152
The image resolution is fine.

00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:15.252
I also checked the fonts on both PC and mobile.

00:13:21.722 --> 00:13:24.432
Gosh, I'm dying of curiosity.

00:13:25.162 --> 00:13:27.202
Hey, the website goes live today, right?

00:13:28.602 --> 00:13:30.832
What kind of business is he launching?

00:13:31.772 --> 00:13:33.072
I don't know.

00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:35.542
I bet it's an online shopping mall.

00:13:35.842 --> 00:13:37.742
Will he sell local specialities?

00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:43.382
Where are you going?

00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:45.382
I need to open a business bank account...

00:13:45.382 --> 00:13:47.182
- and take care of some things. - I see.

00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:48.752
So, is the website live now?

00:13:48.752 --> 00:13:49.752
What is it for?

00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:50.792
See for yourself.

00:13:50.792 --> 00:13:53.622
It's mamdaerozip.co.kr.

00:13:54.262 --> 00:13:56.432
- Mamdaero... - Mamdaerozip.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:00.502
Mamdaerozip...

00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:02.132
What? It says Mamdaerozip.

00:14:05.942 --> 00:14:06.972
Eun Oh.

00:14:08.602 --> 00:14:11.212

00:14:12.842 --> 00:14:14.542

00:14:25.052 --> 00:14:27.592
We'll match you with a coordinator who can fill in any gaps...

00:14:27.592 --> 00:14:29.862
in your DIY interior design.

00:14:30.132 --> 00:14:33.302

00:14:34.132 --> 00:14:35.202
Eun Oh.

00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:39.102
I knew it.

00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:41.342
You knew what?

00:14:41.872 --> 00:14:44.542
I told you his business talk was just a bluff.

00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:46.582
He'll connect DIY interior design clients...

00:14:46.582 --> 00:14:49.782
with coordinators when he's not even an expert himself?

00:14:50.382 --> 00:14:52.482
How can he even call this a business?

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:54.252
It's not something he can do...

00:14:54.252 --> 00:14:56.422
without a thorough understanding of interior design.

00:14:57.852 --> 00:14:58.852
I guess you're right.

00:14:59.862 --> 00:15:02.662
He has renovated all kinds of houses through his club activities,

00:15:02.662 --> 00:15:05.632
so you could call him a semi-expert, but it still feels out of the blue.

00:15:08.162 --> 00:15:09.232
Is that all he can do?

00:15:18.872 --> 00:15:20.182

00:15:35.092 --> 00:15:36.132
Hey. Wait...

00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:37.332
Hurry.

00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:42.602
Okay.

00:15:43.772 --> 00:15:45.232
(Mamdaerozip)

00:15:45.232 --> 00:15:46.372
(We understand.)

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:48.372
(But what's the reality?)

00:15:51.342 --> 00:15:52.682
This is a lot of food.

00:15:53.342 --> 00:15:54.842
I thought it would just be the two of us.

00:15:56.652 --> 00:15:57.712
Is it a lot?

00:15:57.712 --> 00:15:59.822
This is what you used to eat.

00:16:01.052 --> 00:16:02.822
Oh, right. They don't have Cajun salad here.

00:16:02.822 --> 00:16:04.322
So I ordered steak salad instead.

00:16:04.322 --> 00:16:05.722
You like meat.

00:16:08.892 --> 00:16:09.962
It's for her.

00:16:17.502 --> 00:16:18.632
Lemonade?

00:16:18.632 --> 00:16:19.772
Yes, you silly thing.

00:16:20.442 --> 00:16:21.772
That's what you always had...

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.842
when you were meeting your friends. Your comfort food.

00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:26.212
And lemonade is your favourite.

00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:28.342
Seong Jae.

00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:30.682
Back then, I was studying for the college entrance exam.

00:16:30.682 --> 00:16:33.282
I ate a lot without thinking and weighed over 60kg.

00:16:34.152 --> 00:16:35.782
Don't you see how I look now?

00:16:37.892 --> 00:16:38.922
You don't seem so different.

00:16:38.922 --> 00:16:40.122
Seong Jae!

00:16:42.692 --> 00:16:44.432
To me, you are always...

00:16:44.432 --> 00:16:46.932
Ji Hyuk's little sister.

00:16:47.462 --> 00:16:49.272
This is embarrassing.

00:16:50.572 --> 00:16:51.802
You have to eat them all.

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:54.602
I don't drink lemonade anymore.

00:16:54.602 --> 00:16:55.672
It's too sweet.

00:16:57.012 --> 00:16:58.012
My gosh.

00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:01.382
Do you drink iced Americanos? It's not sweet.

00:17:01.482 --> 00:17:02.952
Gosh, I lost...

00:17:02.952 --> 00:17:04.882
a lot of weight in college and have always looked this way.

00:17:06.282 --> 00:17:08.352
Men don't notice things like that.

00:17:10.392 --> 00:17:13.092
I wanted to buy you everything you liked.

00:17:13.092 --> 00:17:15.062
Take your time and eat them all little by little.

00:17:15.692 --> 00:17:17.292
Is there anything else I ordered that you hate?

00:17:19.602 --> 00:17:20.702
Seong Jae.

00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:23.772
You are refusing to appear on my YouTube channel, right?

00:17:28.272 --> 00:17:29.272
Yes.

00:17:29.642 --> 00:17:32.272
I'll make sure to blur your face.

00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:33.982
It's not just about my face.

00:17:34.482 --> 00:17:36.652
It just doesn't suit me.

00:17:36.652 --> 00:17:38.652
Gaining a few thousand subscribers with me appearing on your channel...

00:17:38.652 --> 00:17:39.952
can't be a fundamental solution.

00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:41.052
That's why I won't do it.

00:17:41.382 --> 00:17:42.382
Come on.

00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:46.722
Listen.

00:17:48.492 --> 00:17:51.292
How about I help you find a job?

00:17:52.392 --> 00:17:53.602
Why would you?

00:17:54.002 --> 00:17:55.232
No, thank you.

00:17:55.232 --> 00:17:57.402
Seong Jae, I don't want to work for a company.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.302
What is it you want, then? Working as a YouTuber?

00:18:00.302 --> 00:18:02.142
I'll become a successful YouTuber...

00:18:02.142 --> 00:18:04.042
and marry a rich man.

00:18:04.812 --> 00:18:06.642
I'll get married for sure.

00:18:07.582 --> 00:18:08.812
A rich man?

00:18:10.212 --> 00:18:11.312
My goodness.

00:18:12.012 --> 00:18:13.522
- Hey, Lee Su Bin. You... - Stop it.

00:18:14.122 --> 00:18:15.582
Don't judge me.

00:18:15.582 --> 00:18:17.322
Being rich isn't the only condition.

00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:20.192
That's why I joined a matchmaking service.

00:18:21.622 --> 00:18:22.932
A matchmaking service?

00:18:23.932 --> 00:18:25.192
Have you lost your mind?

00:18:28.932 --> 00:18:30.302
Do your parents know?

00:18:31.032 --> 00:18:32.302
They don't.

00:18:33.442 --> 00:18:34.672
Listen, Seong Jae.

00:18:34.672 --> 00:18:36.812
You keep judging me rashly with prejudice.

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:38.312
Listen to me first.

00:18:39.242 --> 00:18:42.242
I've come to accept the limitations I was born with,

00:18:42.882 --> 00:18:44.212
so I don't have any complaints.

00:18:44.812 --> 00:18:48.022
But I think I have the right to overcome them.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.352
And money is how you overcome them?

00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:50.692
Being rich is one of them.

00:18:51.122 --> 00:18:53.122
I want someone with a good personality, good looks,

00:18:53.122 --> 00:18:54.562

00:18:54.562 --> 00:18:57.332
and a good family background and genuine love for me.

00:18:57.562 --> 00:18:59.062
That's why I joined a matchmaking service...

00:18:59.062 --> 00:19:00.262
that can offer those things.

00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:03.972
I want to meet someone who fits the description and start dating.

00:19:06.672 --> 00:19:08.272
You have your own logic.

00:19:08.642 --> 00:19:10.612
This is a reasonable choice.

00:19:10.612 --> 00:19:12.312
Marriage should be a win-win for both people involved.

00:19:13.482 --> 00:19:14.782
Oh, dear.

00:19:15.542 --> 00:19:17.152
You do sound like Lee Ji Hyuk's sister.

00:19:18.512 --> 00:19:20.522
I'm sure I can be a good partner,

00:19:20.522 --> 00:19:22.052
whether in dating or marriage.

00:19:22.822 --> 00:19:25.592
But ordinary people like me getting married just for love?

00:19:26.162 --> 00:19:27.722
I don't want that.

00:19:27.722 --> 00:19:29.222
I don't want to live a life of hardship.

00:19:29.592 --> 00:19:31.432

00:23:20.592 --> 00:23:22.662
How about you come to my office?

00:23:22.662 --> 00:23:24.032
I'm actually nearby.

00:23:24.132 --> 00:23:25.662
Your office is inside a cafe, right?

00:23:25.832 --> 00:23:27.202
Yes, that's right.

00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:30.332
Sure, I'll see you in a bit.

00:23:30.732 --> 00:23:31.732
Got it.

00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:36.472
Ji Hyuk, these came in for you.

00:23:36.642 --> 00:23:37.672
Thanks.

00:23:38.172 --> 00:23:39.242
Well...

00:23:39.882 --> 00:23:41.382
Sorry about that.

00:23:42.182 --> 00:23:44.282
I did write that my office was inside the cafe.

00:23:44.282 --> 00:23:46.652
I just took it off the courier's hands.

00:23:47.752 --> 00:23:48.752
Anyway, what is all that?

00:23:50.422 --> 00:23:51.452
What?

00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:56.562
I see.

00:23:57.332 --> 00:23:58.692
(Mamdaerozip)

00:23:58.692 --> 00:24:00.102
The Mamdaerozip vest.

00:24:01.362 --> 00:24:02.802
I see.

00:24:07.102 --> 00:24:08.472
(Mamdaerozip, Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:24:08.472 --> 00:24:10.172
When did you prepare all of this?

00:24:10.472 --> 00:24:11.812
Didn't you get back to Seoul recently?

00:24:12.012 --> 00:24:13.212
We live in the age of e-commerce.

00:24:16.282 --> 00:24:18.512
Did you set all this up before coming to Seoul?

00:24:19.012 --> 00:24:20.082
Probably, right?

00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:22.252
(Mail, Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:24:24.192 --> 00:24:25.352
(Applying for the coordinator role)

00:24:25.352 --> 00:24:26.422
(Coordinator, Hong Si Eun)

00:24:26.922 --> 00:24:28.022
I'll leave you to it.

00:24:29.362 --> 00:24:30.392
Sure.

00:24:35.532 --> 00:24:36.572
Hey, Director Seong Jae.

00:24:40.372 --> 00:24:41.402
There.

00:24:42.042 --> 00:24:44.042
- Did you check his website? - Yes, I did.

00:24:48.512 --> 00:24:49.542
Eun Oh.

00:24:50.712 --> 00:24:52.012
Hey, Director Park.

00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:53.722
Eun Oh's busy, so go about your day.

00:24:55.852 --> 00:24:58.652
Just so you know, Ji Hyuk seemed extremely busy too.

00:25:01.862 --> 00:25:05.432
I see. You worked at that company for less than a year.

00:25:05.432 --> 00:25:07.032
(Hong Si Eun, 1 year)

00:25:07.532 --> 00:25:08.632
Got it.

00:25:10.632 --> 00:25:12.402
Sure, thank you.

00:25:17.512 --> 00:25:19.272
- I'll take that. - Right.

00:25:19.842 --> 00:25:22.182
It's orange jasmine. I hear it purifies the air.

00:25:22.912 --> 00:25:23.982
How sweet of you.

00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:28.722
(Mamdaerozip)

00:25:32.722 --> 00:25:33.722
Oh, right.

00:25:34.862 --> 00:25:36.562
How has it been for you?

00:25:37.292 --> 00:25:38.362
I bet you have nothing to say.

00:25:38.992 --> 00:25:41.302
Seong Jae, even if you do, just keep it to yourself.

00:25:42.562 --> 00:25:43.932
Still, remember this.

00:25:44.302 --> 00:25:46.072
This is the first page of your best friend...

00:25:46.272 --> 00:25:48.202
Lee Ji Hyuk's second chapter.

00:25:49.742 --> 00:25:51.812
Sure, I'll keep that in mind.

00:25:52.142 --> 00:25:53.212
It's too bad, though.

00:25:53.412 --> 00:25:54.982
I don't have time to chitchat.

00:25:55.082 --> 00:25:56.442
I'm busy with work, you see.

00:25:56.442 --> 00:25:59.052
When will you give me some of your time?

00:25:59.652 --> 00:26:00.922
I just got back to Seoul, you know.

00:26:02.022 --> 00:26:04.022
Didn't Eun Oh tell you...

00:26:04.022 --> 00:26:05.152
I was extremely busy?

00:26:11.192 --> 00:26:12.532
Doesn't the office make you laugh?

00:26:12.932 --> 00:26:14.902
It's like both a storage area and an office.

00:26:16.202 --> 00:26:19.232
It's like an office that's also a storage area.

00:26:19.232 --> 00:26:20.302
Right.

00:26:20.802 --> 00:26:22.742
By the way, where will we gather this week?

00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.742
We should ask our captain.

00:26:25.372 --> 00:26:26.372
The captain?

00:26:26.542 --> 00:26:27.942
Is it me you're talking about?

00:26:28.342 --> 00:26:31.252
Of course. You must be busy with your new project and all.

00:26:32.252 --> 00:26:35.452
We can only gather once the captain issues the order.

00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:37.452
- Absolutely. - Come on, Director Park.

00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:43.462
What was that? Did you just punch me?

00:26:43.462 --> 00:26:45.132
As the captain, I have that right.

00:26:45.262 --> 00:26:46.602
Is that so? Here.

00:26:46.732 --> 00:26:48.832
Look at that. One, two. Nice.

00:26:48.932 --> 00:26:50.672
Oh, my. Is that how it is?

00:26:50.732 --> 00:26:52.532
- Take that! - Hey, my goodness.

00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:53.572
Excuse me.

00:26:54.172 --> 00:26:55.572
Where can I find Mamdaerozip?

00:26:56.402 --> 00:26:57.942
- Well... - Over here.

00:26:57.942 --> 00:26:59.672
- Please come this way. - Right.

00:27:04.182 --> 00:27:07.252
You want to confirm the job request right now?

00:27:09.652 --> 00:27:11.252
I'm fed up with trying to find...

00:27:11.252 --> 00:27:12.652
the right contractor.

00:27:13.662 --> 00:27:15.092
Won't the coordinator hire contractors...

00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.832
and oversee the entire process?

00:27:17.162 --> 00:27:18.962
That was music to my ears.

00:27:20.762 --> 00:27:21.762
Then, would you like...

00:27:22.262 --> 00:27:24.302
- to sign the contract right now? - Yes.

00:27:27.842 --> 00:27:30.452
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

00:27:41.922 --> 00:27:43.162
Can we talk?

00:27:44.632 --> 00:27:46.462
I don't talk to strangers.

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:50.102
I just opened my business but managed to land a client.

00:27:51.502 --> 00:27:54.842
I was hoping you could take that client on as a coordinator.

00:27:57.012 --> 00:27:59.082
- I won't. - I'll pay 20,000 dollars.

00:27:59.982 --> 00:28:01.682
Most coordinators get just a few thousand,

00:28:02.182 --> 00:28:03.512
but you're offering 20,000?

00:28:04.252 --> 00:28:05.952
That's because you're not just any coordinator.

00:28:06.152 --> 00:28:07.622
I'm trying to book you because I trust you,

00:28:07.622 --> 00:28:08.752
and I need you for my first client.

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:14.192
I already have coordinators applying,

00:28:14.662 --> 00:28:15.762
and more will be coming in tomorrow.

00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:18.132
I'm not asking you because I have no other options.

00:28:19.162 --> 00:28:20.202
I won't do it.

00:28:22.102 --> 00:28:24.802
You won't accept a job that pays 20,000 dollars?

00:28:24.972 --> 00:28:26.302
Don't speak so casually to me.

00:28:32.642 --> 00:28:33.982
I knew you wouldn't accept it,

00:28:35.612 --> 00:28:37.512
but I figured I'd give it a try.

00:28:38.282 --> 00:28:39.322
That's how desperate I am.

00:28:46.092 --> 00:28:47.162
Just to be clear,

00:28:48.692 --> 00:28:49.992
that was only a business proposal,

00:28:51.092 --> 00:28:52.132
Ji Eun Oh.

00:28:57.972 --> 00:28:59.242
Whatever.

00:28:59.842 --> 00:29:02.472
I agreed to stay on the condition that he stayed out of my way.

00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:11.182
Of course, she wouldn't accept it.

00:29:12.382 --> 00:29:15.182
Hold on. Why won't she take the job?

00:29:15.482 --> 00:29:16.792
I offered 20,000 dollars.

00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:21.792
Does she despise me that much?

00:29:23.732 --> 00:29:26.562
I expected nothing less from you, Ji Eun Oh.

00:29:28.132 --> 00:29:29.972
Wasn't taking over the storage enough?

00:29:29.972 --> 00:29:31.502
He sure has some nerve trying to recruit me.

00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:32.872
Over my dead body.

00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:35.272
I wouldn't, not even for 200,000 dollars.

00:29:37.712 --> 00:29:39.212
Actually, I would for 200,000 dollars.

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:43.982
(Neo Credit)

00:29:46.382 --> 00:29:48.052
A 675 percent profit!

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:50.122
No way. I hit the jackpot.

00:29:51.192 --> 00:29:52.792
It'd be dumb to sell right now.

00:29:52.792 --> 00:29:54.062
I bet it'll go up more.

00:29:55.292 --> 00:29:56.862
You'll actually get 100,000 dollars?

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:58.392
How?

00:29:59.202 --> 00:30:00.762
Like this.

00:30:01.932 --> 00:30:04.802
No, don't get greedy. I should just pull out now.

00:30:05.302 --> 00:30:06.642
I'll put 100,000 dollars into the investment...

00:30:06.642 --> 00:30:08.242
and 50,000 into buying a new car.

00:30:10.272 --> 00:30:12.742
Don't get greedy, and take the win.

00:30:15.882 --> 00:30:17.082
(Sell for cash)

00:30:18.382 --> 00:30:19.382
Wait.

00:30:21.622 --> 00:30:22.822
What's wrong with this?

00:30:24.922 --> 00:30:25.922
What...

00:30:27.162 --> 00:30:28.162
What?

00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:31.162
What on earth?

00:30:32.632 --> 00:30:33.932
My 155,000 dollars.

00:30:34.862 --> 00:30:36.072
I'm home.

00:30:36.432 --> 00:30:38.272
Come on in. I bet it was a long day.

00:30:40.342 --> 00:30:43.072
He probably heard you, so why is Gang Oh still in his room?

00:30:43.812 --> 00:30:45.412
Why would he come out just because I'm home?

00:30:45.912 --> 00:30:47.112
I'm sure he's playing a video game.

00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:49.282
He's not. He said he had...

00:30:49.282 --> 00:30:51.052
some good news to tell you.

00:30:52.012 --> 00:30:54.852
Would anything he says ever sound like good news to me, Mom?

00:31:02.932 --> 00:31:03.932
Ji Gang Oh.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.762
I heard you were up just a second ago.

00:31:05.762 --> 00:31:06.962
Why are you pretending to be asleep?

00:31:12.032 --> 00:31:13.772
He always falls asleep right away.

("Short Philosophical Essays" by Arthur Schopenhauer)

00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:29.622
You seem pretty absorbed in that book these days.

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.092
The writing has such depth...

00:31:32.092 --> 00:31:34.022
that I want to memorize all the sentences,

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.032
despite their brevity.

00:31:37.632 --> 00:31:38.632
Honey,

00:31:38.892 --> 00:31:42.002
why is there so much to learn in the world?

00:31:43.802 --> 00:31:46.742
"This is how you should live your one life."

00:31:48.372 --> 00:31:51.042
But no one can live by doing only what they want.

00:31:51.612 --> 00:31:54.412
I can see that our views on life are quite different.

00:31:54.982 --> 00:31:55.982
Goodness.

00:31:55.982 --> 00:31:58.612
That means we don't have the same views on life.

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:03.322
Still, we're perfectly matched in harmony.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.592
Sharing the same views doesn't make a harmonious couple.

00:32:07.162 --> 00:32:09.162
You're a born mediator.

00:32:10.392 --> 00:32:13.602
I've only been struggling to follow in your footsteps.

00:32:15.902 --> 00:32:16.932
By the way,

00:32:17.372 --> 00:32:20.072
have you been trying to find someone for Seong Jae to marry?

00:32:21.342 --> 00:32:23.172
Of course, I have,

00:32:23.172 --> 00:32:24.772
but it's easier said than done.

00:32:28.382 --> 00:32:30.252
Maybe we should grab a drink together.

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:35.022
You said I should wait for him to make the first move,

00:32:36.892 --> 00:32:40.062
but I can't read him at all.

00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:43.432
He's been like that since he was a kid.

00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:46.662
Don't you see that's why you can't push him?

00:32:47.302 --> 00:32:49.972
Still, he'll take over the company someday.

00:32:50.472 --> 00:32:54.302
I feel bad that we burdened him with the director position.

00:32:54.642 --> 00:32:55.772
It weighs on me.

00:32:56.342 --> 00:32:59.512
He's not like you at all.

00:33:00.242 --> 00:33:02.542
You enjoy taking on challenges...

00:33:02.542 --> 00:33:03.982
and expressing your opinions strongly.

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:08.052
Our Seong Jae, on the other hand, isn't as ambitious.

00:33:10.452 --> 00:33:12.122
That's the problem.

00:33:14.162 --> 00:33:15.492
Tell me about it.

00:33:15.762 --> 00:33:17.762
That's why it scares me...

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:20.062
to push him with company work.

is my brother's friend's younger brother.

He's about two years older than I am.

How should I address him?

00:38:25.502 --> 00:38:28.372
Is your brother good friends with the driver's brother?

00:38:29.172 --> 00:38:32.442
Yes, he told me that he had great trust in that friend.

00:38:33.442 --> 00:38:35.482
It would be appropriate...

00:38:35.482 --> 00:38:38.352
to call him by his name or add Mr. before it.

00:38:39.352 --> 00:38:40.352
I see.

00:38:40.882 --> 00:38:43.792
I shouldn't have called him a chauffeur or sir.

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.362
Since it's temporary, he's not an employee...

00:38:46.362 --> 00:38:48.122
but a part-timer.

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:52.962

Why are you suddenly speaking so politely?

Yes. Humans can't beat AI.

We operate with a single value system,

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:27.352

Ask AI everything from now on.

00:41:32.252 --> 00:41:35.192

Okay. We're off!

00:41:53.282 --> 00:41:56.212
I emailed you the revised floor plan and quote.

00:41:56.952 --> 00:41:58.682
It includes everything you asked for.

00:42:00.082 --> 00:42:01.852
Take a look and call me back.

00:42:02.352 --> 00:42:03.392

Oh, right.

You can't work here at night...

the high-paying client since then?

00:42:35.382 --> 00:42:36.622

Ta-da.

00:43:09.022 --> 00:43:10.992
I guess I stayed because I knew you'd come by.

00:43:16.862 --> 00:43:18.092

Can't I sit outside to drink a coffee I paid for?

00:43:33.282 --> 00:43:34.342
I mean,

00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:37.412
I thought you didn't have the time to drink coffee.

00:43:37.552 --> 00:43:39.452

Hey.

00:43:43.752 --> 00:43:45.422

For Eun Oh?

00:43:49.192 --> 00:43:51.732
It's her dad's death anniversary.

00:43:52.392 --> 00:43:53.402
Yes.

00:43:54.002 --> 00:43:55.002
I see.

00:43:57.702 --> 00:43:58.732
Why would you...

00:43:59.632 --> 00:44:02.142
buy her fruit on her dad's death anniversary?

00:44:02.602 --> 00:44:03.642
Why not?

00:44:03.972 --> 00:44:06.982
Can't I buy fruit for a junior's dad's death anniversary?

00:44:06.982 --> 00:44:08.942
I bought it for her to share with her family.

00:44:09.952 --> 00:44:10.952
Did you?

00:44:11.082 --> 00:44:13.882
Eun Oh doesn't like bananas. She doesn't eat them.

00:44:14.222 --> 00:44:16.122
- What? - Ask her yourself.

00:44:17.452 --> 00:44:19.622
Yes. I don't like bananas.

00:44:20.762 --> 00:44:22.192
I sent you bananas...

00:44:22.792 --> 00:44:24.432
when you were ill.

00:44:24.432 --> 00:44:27.032
Just seeing fruit you don't like can make you feel sick.

00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:28.062
Didn't you know that?

00:44:28.762 --> 00:44:31.032
That's no reason to eat what isn't yours.

00:44:33.302 --> 00:44:34.302
Well...

00:44:35.642 --> 00:44:37.512
I thought he'd bought it for me.

00:44:38.272 --> 00:44:39.942
You should go, Eun Oh.

00:44:39.942 --> 00:44:41.182
- It'll be rush hour soon. - Okay.

00:44:41.342 --> 00:44:43.142
I'll offer this to my dad...

00:44:43.352 --> 00:44:46.152
and then share it with my family. Thanks.

00:44:46.282 --> 00:44:47.622
- See you tomorrow, Su Jeong. - Bye.

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:57.432
How do you know her dad's death anniversary?

00:44:57.692 --> 00:44:58.792
I heard...

00:44:59.232 --> 00:45:01.302
he died when Eun Oh was in her last year of high school.

00:45:01.302 --> 00:45:03.032
That means he died young.

00:45:03.032 --> 00:45:04.432
How did he die?

00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:07.742
Hey, you don't know that when you're close enough to know...

00:45:07.742 --> 00:45:08.842
his death anniversary?

00:45:08.842 --> 00:45:09.842

Hey.

00:45:17.312 --> 00:45:19.612
I think he's upset with you.

00:45:21.252 --> 00:45:22.322
"You don't know that?"

00:45:22.752 --> 00:45:24.152
Let him be upset.

00:45:30.662 --> 00:45:32.492
If Eun Oh was a senior when he died...

00:45:34.132 --> 00:45:36.062
He was way younger than my father.

(CO Distribution Center)

00:45:43.102 --> 00:45:44.942
You can go.

00:45:47.442 --> 00:45:50.712
(CO Distribution Center)

00:46:03.592 --> 00:46:04.732
Go on.

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:06.692
- Good job. - Well done.

00:46:06.732 --> 00:46:07.732
Good work.

00:46:08.562 --> 00:46:11.002
- Good job. - Well done.

00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:12.772
(CO Distribution Center)

00:46:12.772 --> 00:46:13.802
Well done.

00:46:14.202 --> 00:46:15.402
Oh, my gosh.

00:46:16.872 --> 00:46:17.912
Oh, dear.

00:46:19.842 --> 00:46:20.882
Goodness.

00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:28.197
My dad.

00:46:28.767 --> 00:46:31.207
How many times did I make tteokbokki for him?

00:46:32.807 --> 00:46:34.477
It has been 12 years already.

00:46:35.537 --> 00:46:36.547
My gosh.

00:46:37.847 --> 00:46:40.177
I should've made this for him before he died.

00:46:42.587 --> 00:46:44.187
If you had,

00:46:44.187 --> 00:46:46.517
he would've been so touched,

00:46:46.517 --> 00:46:49.957
he might've dropped dead on the spot from a heart attack.

00:46:52.127 --> 00:46:54.457
You can be pretty funny sometimes.

00:46:56.767 --> 00:46:59.337
Thinking about him and tteokbokki...

00:46:59.337 --> 00:47:00.767
makes me laugh even now.

00:47:00.767 --> 00:47:02.907
He insisted on eating that with you...

00:47:02.907 --> 00:47:04.137
and no one else.

00:47:04.137 --> 00:47:06.137
Gang Oh and I were always left out.

00:47:08.177 --> 00:47:10.577
That's why I thought...

00:47:11.007 --> 00:47:12.877
Dad loved tteokbokki.

00:47:13.817 --> 00:47:15.547
He just pretended to like it...

00:47:16.047 --> 00:47:17.447
because it was my favourite.

00:47:20.317 --> 00:47:23.187
I bet your dad is happy even now.

00:47:24.757 --> 00:47:27.927
Because it means you value your memories with him.

00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:33.897
I miss him.

00:47:52.317 --> 00:47:53.317
Honey.

00:47:54.487 --> 00:47:55.927
You're well, aren't you?

00:47:57.757 --> 00:48:00.657
Eun Oh, Gang Oh, and I...

00:48:04.267 --> 00:48:06.137
We don't do as well as when you were around,

00:48:06.137 --> 00:48:07.397
but we're doing okay.

00:48:08.297 --> 00:48:09.967
I owe Eun Oh a lot.

00:48:11.037 --> 00:48:13.637
The daughter you cherished so much...

00:48:13.907 --> 00:48:16.107
is now the head of the family in your place.

00:48:16.247 --> 00:48:18.377
She opened a restaurant for me.

00:48:19.247 --> 00:48:21.647
Of course. Everything's all thanks to Eun Oh.

00:48:23.387 --> 00:48:26.057
I'm doing so well...

00:48:26.987 --> 00:48:28.387
thanks to you, Dad.

00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:31.527
You raised me like this.

00:48:48.707 --> 00:48:50.507
Why aren't you doing anything, Dad?

00:48:51.347 --> 00:48:52.977
Why are you just watching me?

00:48:53.447 --> 00:48:54.777
Because I believe in you.

00:48:55.347 --> 00:48:56.347
What?

00:48:58.917 --> 00:49:00.817
Even if I don't do anything,

00:49:01.157 --> 00:49:03.287
you are strong enough...

00:49:03.287 --> 00:49:05.627
to overcome everything on your own...

00:49:05.627 --> 00:49:07.697
even when you are sad, upset, or scared.

00:49:08.197 --> 00:49:09.227
Am I?

00:49:09.767 --> 00:49:10.827
Don't you think so?

00:49:12.597 --> 00:49:13.667
You're right.

00:49:14.437 --> 00:49:15.567
Of course, I am.

00:49:17.237 --> 00:49:20.337
That's why I believe in you all the time.

00:49:25.747 --> 00:49:28.117
Mom, I have Dad's tenacity, right?

00:49:28.547 --> 00:49:30.047
He was gentle,

00:49:30.047 --> 00:49:31.747
but he could be ruthless when he had to be.

00:49:32.757 --> 00:49:35.717
That's why he succeeded on his own.

00:49:38.087 --> 00:49:39.597
I didn't know that back then.

00:49:40.757 --> 00:49:43.467
Thanks to your dad, I lived like a queen.

00:49:44.867 --> 00:49:46.437
Then why did he go bankrupt?

00:49:46.437 --> 00:49:47.667
He should've managed things well until the end.

00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:50.167
Ji Gang Oh, shut it.

00:49:50.607 --> 00:49:52.977
You two should keep praising Dad.

00:49:53.337 --> 00:49:55.377
Dad would always put you first and didn't care much about me...

00:49:55.377 --> 00:49:57.007
because I wasn't as good at studying as you.

00:49:57.607 --> 00:49:58.907
I was talented in soccer.

00:50:00.177 --> 00:50:02.417
He just doesn't know much about his dad.

00:50:02.987 --> 00:50:04.387
It's over, so I'm going out.

00:50:04.647 --> 00:50:05.747
I have plans.

00:50:05.847 --> 00:50:06.857
Gang Oh.

00:50:07.757 --> 00:50:10.127
Is something wrong? Tell me.

00:50:10.127 --> 00:50:11.127
What if it is?

00:50:11.187 --> 00:50:13.027
Are you being feisty because it's Dad's death anniversary?

00:50:13.727 --> 00:50:14.827
Don't act like you know it all.

00:50:14.827 --> 00:50:16.227
You can't solve anything.

00:50:16.227 --> 00:50:18.697
Hey, come over here!

00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:20.937
Hello?

00:50:21.637 --> 00:50:22.837
Eun Oh, that's enough.

00:50:25.907 --> 00:50:26.977
By the way,

00:50:27.837 --> 00:50:30.507
I'm worried if he's in some kind of trouble.

00:50:32.007 --> 00:50:34.577
No way. I'm sure everything's okay.

00:50:51.827 --> 00:50:53.137
What's wrong?

00:50:55.567 --> 00:50:56.837
Is he sick?

00:51:01.337 --> 00:51:04.307
Why are you groaning in your sleep?

00:51:05.107 --> 00:51:06.117
Are you feeling unwell?

00:51:06.877 --> 00:51:09.947
No. I'm fine. Go back to sleep.

00:51:38.907 --> 00:51:39.917
Check the schedule.

00:51:40.217 --> 00:51:43.347
Okay. Then please send me the dates when you're free.

00:51:43.417 --> 00:51:44.417
Thank you.

00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:45.417
Bye.

00:51:46.957 --> 00:51:49.527
Su Jeong told me I'd be the only one working in the morning.

00:51:49.587 --> 00:51:50.927
You came early.

00:51:51.357 --> 00:51:52.587
I have some work to do.

00:51:52.957 --> 00:51:55.927
Eun Oh!

00:51:56.767 --> 00:51:57.967
- Eun Oh! - What is it?

00:51:57.967 --> 00:51:59.127
What's wrong?

00:51:59.797 --> 00:52:01.097
I need help.

00:52:01.537 --> 00:52:03.107
You have 30,000 dollars, right?

00:52:03.107 --> 00:52:05.707
Can you give me 20,000 dollars?

00:52:07.737 --> 00:52:10.607
When it comes to a house, you must always listen to the wife.

00:52:10.607 --> 00:52:12.947
And I know how to handle the ladies.

00:52:13.347 --> 00:52:14.877
You said you quit the interior design business...

00:52:14.877 --> 00:52:16.487
with your friend...

00:52:16.487 --> 00:52:17.847
because of differences of opinion, right?

00:52:17.847 --> 00:52:21.317
Yes. It's not like two people can always work equally,

00:52:21.317 --> 00:52:24.027
so it's stressful to split the money 50-50.

00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:28.297
I see. I understand.

00:52:28.297 --> 00:52:30.127
- I'll give you a call later. - Sure.

00:52:30.897 --> 00:52:33.537
Ji Gang Oh, what did you just say?

00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:36.137
You put Mom's restaurant up as collateral?

00:52:36.137 --> 00:52:39.007
That's not what's important now. I'm dying here.

00:52:39.437 --> 00:52:41.337
Did you just say you borrowed money from a loan shark?

00:52:41.677 --> 00:52:42.677
- Yes. - This way.

00:52:42.677 --> 00:52:44.907
I borrowed 20,000 dollars from a loan shark.

00:52:45.247 --> 00:52:47.917
If I don't pay it back, I'll lose my hand.

00:52:48.747 --> 00:52:50.417
My goodness.

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:53.087
The cafe is so nice and big, Boss.

00:52:54.417 --> 00:52:55.617
Excuse me.

00:52:56.627 --> 00:52:58.357
Unfortunately, there are no customers.

00:52:58.357 --> 00:52:59.357
Eun Oh.

00:53:02.727 --> 00:53:03.927
I won't excuse you.

00:53:04.767 --> 00:53:05.767
Hey.

00:53:06.797 --> 00:53:08.337
You brat. Hey.

00:53:08.337 --> 00:53:10.907
Why are you spouting words that are out of place and time?

00:53:10.907 --> 00:53:12.007
I'm sorry, Boss.

00:53:12.837 --> 00:53:15.207
The one who made us come here is your brother,

00:53:15.677 --> 00:53:16.907
Ji Gang Oh.

00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:18.847
First of all,

00:53:19.277 --> 00:53:21.917
he's the one you lent money to.

00:53:22.347 --> 00:53:25.647
And forcing his family to pay the debt is against the law.

00:53:26.017 --> 00:53:28.557
So stop making a fuss and get out of here.

00:53:28.587 --> 00:53:30.157
Don't even try to mess with me.

00:53:33.527 --> 00:53:34.557
Then,

00:53:35.457 --> 00:53:38.727
I'll take your mom's restaurant, okay?

00:53:39.227 --> 00:53:41.937
I know. I get that.

00:53:42.197 --> 00:53:44.367
I'll figure things out myself.

00:53:44.967 --> 00:53:46.677
So get out of here right now!

00:53:46.777 --> 00:53:50.707
My gosh. This little brat is acting cute.

00:53:57.617 --> 00:53:59.917
(Summer 2016)

00:53:59.917 --> 00:54:01.287
Isn't this too much?

00:54:01.287 --> 00:54:02.657
Su Jeong, have a drink.

00:54:02.657 --> 00:54:04.827
Let's have fun together. I'm your senior, after all.

00:54:04.827 --> 00:54:06.187
No, I'm okay. My gosh.

00:54:07.397 --> 00:54:08.757
Hey! Kim Tae Ju!

00:54:16.837 --> 00:54:17.837
Hey.

00:54:18.007 --> 00:54:20.677
Stop acting so dirty whenever we have a get-together.

00:54:20.677 --> 00:54:22.377
I don't care if you're a senior or not!

00:54:30.447 --> 00:54:31.447
Hey.

00:54:32.487 --> 00:54:33.957
You're a debtor.

00:54:34.357 --> 00:54:36.627
Until your darn brother gives me my money back,

00:54:36.627 --> 00:54:38.527
I'll do things my way.

00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:40.327
Then take him with you.

00:54:40.327 --> 00:54:41.897
If I take him with me now,

00:54:42.027 --> 00:54:43.867
your brother will lose his hand.

00:54:43.867 --> 00:54:45.297
Go ahead and cut off his hand if you want.

00:54:45.627 --> 00:54:47.437
He should lose his hand if he deserves it.

00:54:48.897 --> 00:54:50.007
Eun Oh.

00:54:50.007 --> 00:54:51.207
You should go with them, Gang Oh.

00:54:53.507 --> 00:54:55.007
You don't seem to understand what we're saying.

00:54:55.277 --> 00:54:57.377
Hold that darn brother.

00:55:08.857 --> 00:55:10.557
You darn brat. Do you want to die?

00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:13.157
Stop! Stop what you're doing.

00:55:16.667 --> 00:55:18.897
I recorded you vandalizing and making threats,

00:55:18.897 --> 00:55:20.267
so go back quietly...

00:55:20.267 --> 00:55:21.867
and never show up here again.

00:55:22.137 --> 00:55:25.007
That's what the manager said.

00:55:25.967 --> 00:55:29.037
Boss, we taught them a lesson today,

00:55:29.037 --> 00:55:30.307
so let's just go back.

00:55:30.507 --> 00:55:33.017
Okay. We should go back today.

00:55:33.277 --> 00:55:36.217
Ji Gang Oh, you have until tomorrow at noon.

00:55:38.047 --> 00:55:40.857
We're going back today, but we will see you tomorrow.

00:55:47.097 --> 00:55:48.697
My office is here.

00:55:48.897 --> 00:55:51.267
Don't disturb me! Darn it.

00:55:58.737 --> 00:55:59.737
Ji Gang Oh.

00:56:01.507 --> 00:56:02.607
You should go.

00:56:03.107 --> 00:56:04.477
How would I go now?

00:56:04.477 --> 00:56:07.277
You fool. Mom must be alone at her restaurant now.

00:56:07.277 --> 00:56:08.817
You should go and protect her from them...

00:56:08.817 --> 00:56:10.387
even if you lose your hand!

00:56:12.187 --> 00:56:14.087
Make sure she won't even get a scratch.

00:56:15.217 --> 00:56:16.317
Eun Oh.

00:56:16.727 --> 00:56:18.287
Do you want me to cut off your hand?

00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:19.557
You know I have an axe.

00:56:20.697 --> 00:56:21.897
Eun Oh!

00:57:32.397 --> 00:57:33.437
Ms. Ji.

00:57:34.597 --> 00:57:35.737
Are you all right?

00:57:35.997 --> 00:57:38.567
Yes, I'm fine. I'm going out.

00:57:43.247 --> 00:57:45.007
(Balance: 29,179 dollars)

00:57:46.177 --> 00:57:48.177
You want 24,000 dollars in cash?

00:57:48.477 --> 00:57:49.677
What is it for?

00:57:50.547 --> 00:57:52.847
The loan sharks are asking for cash.

00:57:53.757 --> 00:57:54.857
Is there a problem?

00:57:55.317 --> 00:57:57.187
(Debt Payment Confirmation)

00:57:57.487 --> 00:57:58.557
(Certificate of Full Payment of Loan)

00:58:02.497 --> 00:58:04.527
Don't lend him money ever again.

00:58:05.467 --> 00:58:08.437
If you do, you won't get even a penny back.

00:58:09.967 --> 00:58:11.637
This is all I have, which is like my life.

00:58:11.967 --> 00:58:15.107
By the way, Ji Eun Oh, what makes you so fearless?

00:58:15.107 --> 00:58:16.977
I stand backed by the laws of our nation.

00:58:17.377 --> 00:58:19.977
I see. Is that why you're being so impolite?

00:58:19.977 --> 00:58:22.277
I won't be polite or formal to people who don't respect me.

00:58:23.987 --> 00:58:25.017
Let's go.

00:58:25.647 --> 00:58:27.357
Why that little...

00:58:30.557 --> 00:58:32.527
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:58:32.587 --> 00:58:34.527
I really thought the website was run by a securities firm.

00:58:35.527 --> 00:58:37.097
You would've thought so too, Eun Oh.

00:58:37.627 --> 00:58:39.937
Besides, you heard the police. I'm not the only one who was duped.

00:58:40.437 --> 00:58:42.137
There are 697 victims.

00:58:42.867 --> 00:58:44.807
You promised two years ago that you wouldn't go near...

00:58:44.807 --> 00:58:46.107
stock recommendation chat rooms again.

00:58:46.707 --> 00:58:47.737
But...

00:58:48.737 --> 00:58:50.447
stock recommendation chat rooms aren't all scams.

00:58:52.977 --> 00:58:54.677
You brat.

00:58:55.177 --> 00:58:57.587
Do you know what that money meant to your sister?

00:58:58.047 --> 00:59:00.987
It's about time she had at least a used car.

00:59:01.057 --> 00:59:03.357
She's been receiving more work lately.

00:59:03.357 --> 00:59:05.157
How is she meant to keep taking the bus?

00:59:05.987 --> 00:59:07.027
My gosh.

00:59:07.457 --> 00:59:08.497
And you...

00:59:08.997 --> 00:59:10.597
Investing in a pick-up bar?

00:59:10.867 --> 00:59:12.397
An investment of 100,000 dollars, might I add?

00:59:12.727 --> 00:59:14.467
How could you even dream of that?

00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:16.267
Where would you get 100,000 dollars?

00:59:16.907 --> 00:59:18.737
That's why I tried to earn the money.

00:59:19.137 --> 00:59:21.107
Everyone invests in stocks and cryptocurrency these days.

00:59:21.177 --> 00:59:22.477
That's the only way to make money.

00:59:22.477 --> 00:59:23.507
Gang Oh, please.

00:59:23.507 --> 00:59:25.447
If you make this restaurant a success,

00:59:25.447 --> 00:59:27.217
you'll get to keep it all...

00:59:27.217 --> 00:59:29.217
once I'm too old to manage it.

00:59:29.447 --> 00:59:31.447
That's what your sister told you to do.

00:59:31.447 --> 00:59:33.087
I have my own dreams, you know.

00:59:33.187 --> 00:59:34.317
If it weren't for my injury,

00:59:34.317 --> 00:59:35.757
I'd be kicking it like Son Heung Min.

00:59:35.817 --> 00:59:37.527
Actually, I wouldn't have ruined my life...

00:59:37.527 --> 00:59:39.127
if I had been able to give private lessons.

00:59:42.427 --> 00:59:43.527
Write an IOU...

00:59:43.727 --> 00:59:45.627
for the 24,000 dollars I covered for you.

00:59:45.667 --> 00:59:47.767
Take just 500 dollars...

00:59:48.467 --> 00:59:49.697
and pay me back 1,000 dollars each month.

00:59:50.137 --> 00:59:51.507
- Eun Oh, please. - Mom.

00:59:52.307 --> 00:59:54.507
Make sure he works until closing time every day.

00:59:54.877 --> 00:59:56.537
Take a photo each day as you close up the restaurant...

00:59:56.537 --> 00:59:57.607
and send it to me.

00:59:57.747 --> 01:00:00.617
If you don't, I won't even let you have 500 dollars.

01:00:02.977 --> 01:00:04.187
- Here you go. - Thank you.

01:00:04.187 --> 01:00:05.217
No problem.

01:00:13.627 --> 01:00:14.727
We should talk.

01:00:16.257 --> 01:00:17.827
The 20,000-dollar job offer.

01:00:20.137 --> 01:00:21.337
Oh, right.

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:23.167
I'll do it.

01:00:24.707 --> 01:00:26.977
Should we write a contract, then?

01:00:27.937 --> 01:00:29.107
Yesterday,

01:00:29.637 --> 01:00:31.407
you said it was a business offer.

01:00:33.107 --> 01:00:35.217
We'll sign a contract, Ms. Ji.

01:00:36.447 --> 01:00:39.017
I'm getting ready to work on an apartment unit in Mapo.

01:00:39.117 --> 01:00:41.217
The schedule could overlap when that project begins.

01:00:41.457 --> 01:00:42.457
Of course.

01:00:42.717 --> 01:00:45.357
A coordinator isn't supposed to be on-site all day anyway.

01:00:48.897 --> 01:00:50.967
(Ji Eun Oh)

01:00:58.767 --> 01:00:59.907
(Agreement for Interior Design Services)

Day one is demolition day.

01:01:04.507 --> 01:01:07.147
The contractor and workers have already been hired.

01:01:08.177 --> 01:01:10.547
Here's the revised schedule.

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:14.757
This is the floor plan confirmed by the client.

01:01:18.187 --> 01:01:20.327
The ten percent down payment will be wired tomorrow morning.

01:01:23.527 --> 01:01:25.027
I'll review the materials today...

01:01:25.127 --> 01:01:27.197
and discuss the details with the client.

01:01:32.467 --> 01:01:33.977
I could've made my own breakfast.

01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:35.807
You barely got any sleep.

01:01:36.807 --> 01:01:39.707
I should cook you breakfast on the first day of a project.

01:01:39.707 --> 01:01:40.977
You're heading out to work at 6am.

01:01:41.947 --> 01:01:43.017
What worries me...

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:47.087
is that I won't be there to check on Ggang Oh.

01:01:47.487 --> 01:01:50.557
Up until now, I've been dropping by unannounced to check on him.

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:53.627
No one in his right mind...

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:55.127
would break his promise after ten days...

01:01:55.127 --> 01:01:56.897
simply because you aren't around.

01:01:58.227 --> 01:01:59.267
Right?

01:02:00.897 --> 01:02:02.897
That childish brat.

01:02:07.177 --> 01:02:08.207
What?

01:02:09.207 --> 01:02:11.147
The demolition guy wouldn't know the lock code.

01:02:22.817 --> 01:02:23.827
What?

01:02:25.727 --> 01:02:26.757
What's this?

01:02:26.757 --> 01:02:29.557
Are you here as the boss because this is your first project?

01:02:29.927 --> 01:02:30.927
No.

01:02:31.427 --> 01:02:32.427
Then, what?

01:02:32.427 --> 01:02:34.967
I'm here as a worker today.

01:02:36.137 --> 01:02:37.437
A worker?

01:02:37.737 --> 01:02:40.407
You need workers on-site on demolition day.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.177
That'd be me.

01:02:43.777 --> 01:02:44.907
Let me get this straight.

01:02:45.277 --> 01:02:47.917
You'll be working here today?

01:02:48.877 --> 01:02:50.647
Yes, right here.

(Our Golden Days)

01:03:37.827 --> 01:03:40.097
This means I'm a lousy excuse for a father.

01:03:40.097 --> 01:03:42.337
- Hey, Ji Hyuk. - Ji Hyuk!

01:03:42.337 --> 01:03:43.507
If you actually understood,

01:03:43.507 --> 01:03:45.167
you would've come home since you were in Seoul.

01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:46.207
How could you not even call?

01:03:46.237 --> 01:03:48.707
You don't have the right to be sarcastic with me.

01:03:48.707 --> 01:03:51.247
Seong Jae and I go back nine years.

01:03:51.377 --> 01:03:52.877
You really think less of me, don't you?

01:03:52.907 --> 01:03:54.577
Whether I succeed or fail,

01:03:54.577 --> 01:03:55.817
I'll do it on my own without relying on you.

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:57.917
Like that's enough to recharge you,

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.287
when I know how much you eat.

01:03:59.347 --> 01:04:02.217
Ms. Ji, how could you possibly tell how much strangers eat?

01:04:02.387 --> 01:04:04.157
Let's just be like strangers, okay?

01:04:04.157 --> 01:04:05.357
What's so hard about that?

01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:07.197
You're the one who barged in here!
