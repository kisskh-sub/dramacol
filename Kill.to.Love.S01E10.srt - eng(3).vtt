00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.760
(Episode 10)

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920
Go!

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.679
I'm escorting
the South Hui emperor's bodyguard.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.440
He's a difficult fellow.
He kept trying to escape.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
He slowed me down.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960
He's a talker.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.040
It's annoying. Let me in quickly.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.040
Get up. Let's go!

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480
Sir, what is going on?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.920
Today is the day you are executed.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.799
Wait!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.079
He only changed
an unimportant detail in the manor.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.240
Why do you have
to punish him so severely?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.039
Disobeying His Majesty's order...

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.119
is punishable by death!

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.919
- Punishable by death?
- Don't argue with him.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
Just drag him away!

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.959
He changed
the layout of the residence...

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.839
to improve the feng shui
of the imperial family's residence.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.999
Did Duan Zi Ang
actually sentence him to death?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.759
How dare the lowly ruler
of South Hui...

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.839
speak His Majesty's name?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.680
He's killing innocents.
He's not fit to be the emperor!

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.919
Don't touch me.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
Let go of me!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
How dare you run your mouth?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.080
That's for talking!

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.200
Serves you right for yapping!

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040
Big Brother.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.360
You're recovering well.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920
You woke up...

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.480
two hours earlier than I expected.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.320
How do you feel now?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720
I'm fine now.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.960
But I heard
Shu He's shrill scream just now.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.920
It woke me up from my dream.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080
Scream?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.520
We've been standing guard here.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.320
Except for the sound of the wind,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760
there was no other sound.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440
The dungeon is far from the palace.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.520
You must have had a nightmare.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.760
Maybe it was a dream.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.040
But that scream...

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.680
I've never seen him like that.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.800
Thank you for saving my life
yesterday, Shen Song.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
You were lucky.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.000
I abide by medical ethics.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.920
Heaven knows
how much I wanted to poison you...

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.559
and fulfill my selfish wish.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560
You...

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.880
Ji North razed South Hui
to the ground.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.360
I can understand
your wish for revenge.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.880
But Ji North has never
massacred South Hui's people.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.480
We also tried to capture
the South Hui soldiers alive.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.879
South Hui has been
in a drought for years.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.439
I've provided food for them.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.920
I've saved countless lives.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.120
But you don't
appreciate my kindness.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.560
You still want to kill me.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.560
I really don't understand.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.800
To me,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600
the kingdom is too big.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.040
The only thing I care about...

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.280
is the one
who loves you wholeheartedly.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.880
This Longjing tea is from South Hui.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480
It's his favorite.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.000
Since he is in your heart,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.040
why did you hurt him?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720
Hurt him?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.840
My brother's illness...

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.480
was from protecting
the very person you mentioned.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600
Why do you say so?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.440
What I did,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.440
killing the emperor and my father,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.800
were all choices
that I was willing to bear.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440
I'll take you...

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.360
to meet someone.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.040
Your Majesty.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
Your Majesty.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680
Huo Ying?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120
Why are you here?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.840
Why did you bring me here?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.840
What are you trying to sell me?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.760
Go forward and ask.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.240
We want to see the commander
of the South Hui Imperial Guards.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.960
His name is Huo Ying.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760
What's the matter?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.680
Where is he?

00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:35.719
Your Majesty,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.720
Huo Ying was knocked out yesterday
and brought here.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.000
He spouted nonsense
as soon as he woke up.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.760
We put a gag on him.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400
Bring him here.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.400
Your Majesty, I deserve to die.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.480
Hurry. Back to the palace!

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880
Huo Ying, get out of here.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240
It's too late for me.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.760
Do you know...

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.720
where our South Hui soldiers are?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.759
They are all imprisoned
in prison camps.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760
They are not in danger for now.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.679
Your Majesty,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.400
the rest of South Hui
has gathered their forces.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.200
They are discussing how to save you.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.920
You must protect yourself.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200
Your Majesty.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
Open the door.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.960
Who did this?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840
Who did this?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400
Zi Ang.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960
Shu He.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
It's me.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.840
The dungeon is cold and damp.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280
If he stays here,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.720
his wounds won't heal.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.800
Let's go back to the palace.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.080
You're familiar with his condition.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.040
Return with me
to my chambers and treat him.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.960
(The Emperor's Quarters,
Ji North Kingdom)

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.760
Let him rest.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.560
I just gave him some medication
to relieve the pain.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.040
It might make him delirious.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.880
It's best to have someone
keep an eye on him.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.560
I'll do it myself.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.680
There are too many people
in the palace who want him dead.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.680
I'll get going then.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.000
If you learn where Huo Ying is,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.520
please let me know immediately.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.640
Go.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.800
Go.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.680
If I had to choose again,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.600
I wouldn't have left.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.680
You love the one who hates you,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.520
and you hate the one who loves you!

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.200
Aren't you both?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840
Don't move.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.040
Where did you get the dagger?

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.479
You have a habit of hiding a blade
under your pillow.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.960
That hasn't changed.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.320
How come I didn't know
you knew how to tie people up?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.600
After I left,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.680
someone taught you something new.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.600
Don't try to flatter me.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.840
Release the prisoners from the camp.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920
Sure.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.640
But you have to stay.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.280
You're in no position to negotiate.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.960
Next time,
tie the ropes more tightly.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.920
A softhearted person can't
sit on the throne.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.880
For example, just now,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.640
you could have stabbed me,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.960
but you didn't dare to press harder.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.160
If it weren't for you,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.320
I wouldn't have been on the throne.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.880
If it weren't for you,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.800
I wouldn't have ended up...

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.520
as a fallen emperor.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560
Today is...

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.400
the death anniversary
of Father and Shu Qian.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.200
Why are you here?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.799
Duan Zi Ang knows you escaped
from the prison camp.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800
That doesn't matter.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.079
What's important now is
to find a chance...

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.520
to get you and His Majesty
out of here.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.200
Duan Zi Ang won't harm Shu He.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600
You, on the other hand,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.480
always put yourself in danger.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.800
You must be more careful.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.000
I'll find a chance
to sneak into the manor.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.400
We'll plan further then.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200
All right.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280
Go on.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840
Shu Qian,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.760
if you were still alive,

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.879
Duan Ziang's valiant cavalry...

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.880
wouldn't have dared to set foot
in the South Hui Kingdom.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.320
I'm useless.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.280
I've let you and Father down.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960
Shu Qian,

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.040
I should be the one who is dead.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160
The emperor of Ji North...

00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:50.360
pays respects
to the former ruler of South Hui.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.240
If word gets out,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.280
you won't be able to sit
on the throne anymore.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.200
Between us,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.880
there are too many things
we can't control.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.720
But no matter
how chaotic the world is,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920
Shu He,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.880
I am still Duan Zi Ang.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.560
But at this moment,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.560
things are no longer the same.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.400
As long as you follow your heart,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.440
it doesn't matter
if it's a lie or not.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.560
Shu He,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.240
I still feel that way.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.800
Heart?

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.040
But my heart...

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.160
was once right here.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.760
Now that I think about it,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.440
it was like a prophecy.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.600
My kingdom and family
have been destroyed.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.280
I haven't let go of my hatred
for a single day.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.680
But there is no one...

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.560
I can be honest with.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.760
If I weren't
the emperor of Ji North,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.160
would you still think that way?

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.519
I wanted too much.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.640
I can give you
whatever you want now.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.560
Then release
the South Hui prisoners of war.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.000
Do you know that during the few days
I was in the dungeon,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.200
I was too cold to sleep every night?

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.280
Do you know what I was thinking?

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.520
I've already ordered the guards
to be punished.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.560
They're in prison.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.839
Only the thought
of something they care about...

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.960
can help them through this.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800
It's South Hui.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.520
It's their home.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.120
As for me,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.200
I have nothing left.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.600
Zi Ang,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.120
it hurts so much.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.200
I'll get Shen Song.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.920
He can't cure me.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.120
Come with me to court tomorrow.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.920
Your Majesty,
you released the tiger.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.520
You released the prisoners of war
for no reason.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.480
I really don't understand.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.400
Attack the state
but love the people.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.760
It was fine to attack.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360
But if we don't let them go,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.600
that will only breed resentment.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.240
- Your Majesty!
- I've made up my mind.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.559
Your Majesty,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.960
there's something I don't know.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.040
He is a prisoner of war.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.760
How dare he listen in
on state affairs?

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.799
Your Majesty works hard
for the people...

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.880
and rules the state well.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.200
It is a blessing
for the people of Ji North.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.000
But if Your Majesty insists
on doing things your own way...

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.399
and is bewitched by outsiders,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.080
to do harm to our kingdom,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.879
with all due respect,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.400
even if I am beheaded today,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.440
we firmly oppose it.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.000
- Your Majesty, please reconsider!
- Your Majesty, please reconsider!

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.200
If you let the prisoners go,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.040
I'll give you the information...

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.520
on South Hui's salt mines.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.800
If we confiscate the salt mines,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.120
they can be used to fund the army...

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.560
and fill our coffers for years.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440
In that case,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.280
are you still against it?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.520
Why didn't you say anything
in court just now?

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.400
Actually, I agree
with General Liu and the others.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.479
I just didn't want to oppose you
in front of everyone.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.560
I'm going to release
the prisoners no matter what!

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.640
You have to be on my side.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840
I heard...

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.840
that Shu He was
in your chambers last night.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.360
He's sick.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.720
Regarding the release
of the prisoners,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.000
if you need me,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.840
I'll be there.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.560
Last night, he didn't
do anything to you, did he?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.560
Huo Ying gave me
a secret letter just now.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.640
He said that if you can get
to the south city gate...

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.400
on the day of the Lantern Festival,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.200
he will have a way to get you out.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.640
But now,

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.840
I can't even step out of this manor.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.400
Two days ago,
Duan Zi Ang suddenly fell ill.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.840
I went to treat him.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.320
I talked to him for a while.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.120
He doesn't mean you any harm.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.719
Try to gain his trust...

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.080
so that you can get
to the city gate.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.200
Why don't you pretend
to get close to him?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.720
He destroyed my kingdom
and imprisoned me just to have me.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.360
My lords,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040
there's a message from the palace.

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:36.479
His Majesty has issued
an imperial decree.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.960
The South Hui prisoners will be
gradually released starting today.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.199
On the Lantern Festival,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.520
the prisoners must be reunited
with their families.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.000
If it means I can escape,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.320
it wouldn't be difficult
to do these things.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.120
It's just that only sincere feelings
will be met with a genuine heart.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.720
Don't let yourself be trapped...

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.480
just to earn this trust.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.880
He's willing to release
the South Hui soldiers.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.600
That means he still has you
in his heart.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.000
If you want to exploit this trust,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.640
you can only
rely on your friendship.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.880
If you really can't let go,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.400
then think about how he treated you
after the kingdom collapsed...

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.400
and the situation that
the people of South Hui are in now.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.000
This medicine is good
for your wound too.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.480
If you want,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.360
you can be with him.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.560
I'll leave
after I deliver the medicine.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280
Shu He,

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.200
if you don't leave Ji North,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.080
he'll hurt you even more.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640
Zi Ang.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.720
I brought you some clothes.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.720
Why are you here?

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.640
I heard that you released
the South Hui soldiers.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.120
I'm here to thank you.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.720
You sure picked a good time.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.640
Shen Song prepared some herbs.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.120
He said they can nourish
your qi and blood.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200
He asked me to deliver them.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960
Is this medicine...

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440
nourishing...

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.280
or poisonous?

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.880
It can be applied to heal wounds...

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.520
or smelled to calm the mind.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880
If you don't believe me,

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.960
I can test it on myself.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.000
Let me help you undress.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.920
Are you not going
to make a fuss today?

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.000
You fulfilled my wish.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.920
I'm here to apologize to you.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.120
Sometimes, I really don't get it.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.360
What exactly do you want?

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.880
I know I'm not a hero.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.880
But I will save...

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.480
as many citizens
of South Hui as I can.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.920
Why do I need to be waited on
just to take a bath?

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.360
That's so strange.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.120
It's a normal thing.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.640
What's so strange about it?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.480
Your wound is open.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.440
Back then, you had many injuries.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.680
Now,

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.800
why is it even worse?

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.360
It's not that I don't want
to treat it.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.920
It's that there is no cure.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.880
Why is that?

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.840
What did you say that day...

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.640
to make the guards
to treat you that way?

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.000
I said I was the only one to blame
for the new manor.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560
If anyone should be punished,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.560
I'm the only one
who should be punished.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.040
Everything that I thought
was good for you...

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.760
turned out...

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.280
to be a sharp knife that stabs you.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.520
If I wasn't...

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.320
the sixth prince of South Hui...

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.480
and you weren't
a Red Shadow Guard of Ji North,

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.680
would we...

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.560
still have ended up here today?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.960
I'm sure of it.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.840
I didn't answer you that day...

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.279
because I didn't want...

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.080
to hide my only truth in lies.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.560
It's in the past.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.960
Is it really in the past?

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.560
You're the emperor now.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.320
You can't leave the palace.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.200
But I can see you every day.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.120
That is enough for me.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.040
I asked you to deliver medicine
to the bathhouse.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.480
Why did it turn out
to be a cause for joy and sorrow?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.840
I haven't said anything yet.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.880
How do you know
it was a cause for joy and sorrow?

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.560
Joy,

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.800
because there is
finally music in Ji North.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.840
Sorrow,

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.840
because the melody is woeful.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.240
It's out of tune.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.320
In the end, I couldn't tell...

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.400
if I was lying to him...

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.360
or to myself.
