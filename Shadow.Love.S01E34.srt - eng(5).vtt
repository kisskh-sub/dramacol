00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.960
[Episode 34]

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.280
The first rain of this year

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.480
has finally arrived.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.640
May Yao State be blessed
with favorable weather,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.970
peace, and prosperity,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.910
and may the people

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.960
live better lives.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.560
By the way, Prince Annan,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.150
the house where Miss Li is being held

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.360
has long been in disrepair.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.790
The roof has several leaks.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.850
With the recent strong winds,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.850
should we send someone to repair it?

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.570
What are you doing?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.159
So clumsy.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.350
Just like a prisoner indeed.

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:44.800
Since you can't do it properly,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.770
why didn't you call the guards?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.460
Aren't I a prisoner?

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.240
What right do I have to be picky?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.190
Aren't you quite picky yourself?

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.370
Prince Annan,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.340
what brings you here

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.830
in the middle of the night?

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.730
This house is so dilapidated.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.000
I'm afraid if it collapses
and kills my prisoner,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.330
it would be quite a loss.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.850
I'll take a look.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.570
Since there are guards,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.670
why trouble yourself, Prince Annan?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.970
The guards...

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.390
have their own duties.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.310
Prince Annan,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.690
you're injured?

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.270
Do you need help?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.930
It's fine.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.390
Prince Annan,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.390
you truly are farsighted.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.420
You once sent over ointment for bruises.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.530
Perfect timing.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.660
You could use it yourself now.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.720
Help yourself.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.120
I heard Yao State rarely gets rain,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.920
yet today

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.520
it pours so heavily.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.840
If every year could be like this,

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.760
the people

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.549
would have better lives.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.360
It's weird.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.880
I feel like I've heard these words before.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.400
They're so familiar.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.050
Even this scene in the rain

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.820
feels like something I've experienced.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.070
You took quite a fall today.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.170
After all,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.640
it was because of me.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.410
I'm the kind of person

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.080
who doesn't like owing favors to others.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.220
Remember this pain.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.050
Even though our blood pact

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.200
will disappear
after the Jade Linglong is removed,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.190
this mark

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.430
will remain on your body forever.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.510
This is our new bond.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.830
I was severely injured before.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.740
I've forgotten many things.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.340
This bite mark…

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.670
I don't even know where it came from.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.930
Though you were trained in martial arts,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.560
you do know how to take care of people.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.500
Because in the past,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.700
someone took care of me this way too.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.550
That Jin'an again.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.910
Since you can't let him go,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.550
how about I bring him here

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.220
to keep you company?

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.730
It doesn't matter where he is.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.390
We once promised each other:

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.270
born together,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.100
and die together.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.320
With our hearts connected,

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.860
wherever we go,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.640
it's as if we're by each other's side.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.990
You actually believe such sweet talk?

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.670
How many people in this world

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.860
live for a fleeting promise?

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.460
If a person

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.550
has no faith,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.790
what meaning is there

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.810
in the long journey of life?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.910
How can you be sure

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.040
his heart is unchanged,

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.820
just like yours?

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.120
It's raining heavily outside.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.390
You're injured

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.650
and can't move easily.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.070
Why don't you

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.740
stay here tonight?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.630
You don't even care about propriety
between men and women?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.540
Prince Annan,

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.510
are you afraid
I might have improper thoughts?

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.550
Walking out from here
in the middle of the night

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.810
with an injured waist…

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.660
it would cause even more gossip.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.860
This medicine is good
for improving blood circulation.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.910
You'll feel much better by morning.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.490
Where will you sleep then?

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.580
Since you're so concerned
about your reputation,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.910
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.310
Don't think you can pull any tricks

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.460
while I'm asleep.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.110
I've been through countless battles.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.950
I'm alert enough to notice that.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.790
I told you...

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.700
I could die for you.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.470
Every debt

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.010
has a debtor.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.270
I will make Li Wei pay

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.910
the blood debt he owes me.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.060
Although I know it's unlikely,

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.080
I still want to ask you—

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.430
will you go with me?

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.550
Prince Annan, you're awake?

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.540
Get up

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.540
and have some tea.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.220
When did I

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.590
fall asleep last night?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.540
I only know

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.300
that you slept very soundly.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.740
Well, your alertness

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.780
was a bit lacking.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.910
But for someone
who leads troops in battle,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.830
it's rare to get a good night's sleep.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.560
You should be happier about it.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.230
Don't keep such a stern face.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.950
She is an enemy general

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.750
and the daughter of my nemesis‌.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:26.540
I stayed here overnight

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.870
to test her.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.430
How did I end up

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.690
falling asleep without any guard at all?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.280
Prince Annan.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.520
Find a craftsman

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.260
to fix the roof.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:49.890
Yes.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.910
We're in Yao State territory.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.190
Don't act rashly.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.020
Jin'an...

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.380
is actually Duan Aodeng?

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.540
This year,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.540
Shuang has worked tirelessly,

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.630
only to nurture a tiger that will harm us.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.690
But they were once lovers, after all.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.430
How could he harm Shuang?

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.220
It seems Jin'an

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.800
has completely forgotten Li Shuang.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.110
Now, to him,

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.870
Li Shuang is merely an enemy prisoner.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.220
I don't care who he is.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.040
On Wuling Mountain,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.910
Shuang almost died for him.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.340
He is so utterly ungrateful.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.020
I must teach him a lesson.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.460
So what if you were to tear apart
the Yao State imperial palace?

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.930
The most important thing right now

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.580
is to rescue Li Shuang first.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.700
What...

00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.420
Did...

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.040
Did you really pin them down?

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.150
Not only that,

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.260
when they wake up later,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.990
they won't remember seeing us.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.190
But this trick

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.790
can only last for one hour at most.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.850
We have to be quick.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.090
Why are you following me?

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.820
To rescue her.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.110
I should be the one saving my own bestie.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.910
You keep watch at the door.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:29.700
If anyone comes,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.690
or if they wake up,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.580
knock them out.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.220
Be quick.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:35.670
Remember, one hour.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.240
I know that already.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.740
Shuang?

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.300
Shuang!

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:48.590
Shuang.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.390
Lu Xin?

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.880
Why are you here?

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.700
I heard you were captured,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.900
so I came specially to rescue you.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.830
Come with me now.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:57.160
Lu Xin.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.740
I can't leave now.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.700
Why not?

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.880
Not only
is your living situation so humble here,

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.980
but that Duan Aodeng...

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.100
He doesn't even remember you.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.630
He's no longer the Jin'an he used to be.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:17.470
I'm not staying

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.540
because of him.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:24.930
The misunderstandings
between the two countries

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.460
haven't been resolved yet.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.440
If I escape alone,

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.720
it will surely endanger
my fellow prisoners.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.220
If Yao State uses that

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.780
as an excuse to go to war,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.110
it will be the people
of both countries who suffer.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.950
Shuang,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.670
I'm just a wandering doctor.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.440
I don't have
your breadth of mind and vision.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.360
I can't care for the entire world.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.260
I just want you to survive.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.900
If the bloodshed happens again,

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.700
what's the point of my survival?

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.150
But if you stay,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.120
will the war really not break out?

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.020
Duan Aodeng

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.330
is bloodthirsty and warlike.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.620
Can you guarantee
you'll survive in his hands?

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.520
Actually, during this time

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.590
with him,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.870
I've found

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.770
he's not someone
who slaughters the innocent.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.480
Sometimes,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.990
he does show kindness.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.370
Since he wants to use me

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.830
to force Taijin to comply,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.560
he won't rashly start a war.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.470
You're my best friend.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.630
If you want to stay,

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.710
I'll respect your decision.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.480
But I won't let anything happen to you.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.680
Mo Yin and I will protect you in secret,

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.260
until Duan Aodeng

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.210
lets you return safely to Taijin.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.590
Stay calm.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.740
Two days later,

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.940
we'll meet at the inn.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.070
Where did all these scars

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.560
come from?

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.980
She's just a defeated general
of our enemy nation.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.910
Why is it that everything
she says and does

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.000
stirs my heart?

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.000
Why is all of this

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.560
happening?

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.350
Prince Annan.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.140
Take this to her for me.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.610
Yes.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.110
Never mind.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.460
I'll do it myself.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.330
What are you doing up there?

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.760
Getting some fresh air.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.300
Don't worry.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.220
This roof is sturdy.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.870
I won't fall to my death.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.760
Prince Annan, you've been

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.680
visiting too often lately.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.390
What do you mean by that?

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.230
After staying a few days,

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.280
now you act like you own the place,

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.870
telling me to leave?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.700
I can't escape anyway.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.060
If there's nothing urgent,
you don't need to come.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.390
Your eyes look bloodshot from staying up.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.430
You care about me?

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.790
You almost starved yourself to death
before.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.930
If something really happened to you,

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.520
what will I use to negotiate with Taijin?

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.630
Someone sent me a bolt of fabric,

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.210
saying it's a popular pattern in Taijin.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.480
I don't like it.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.350
It's useless to keep it

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.670
and wasteful to throw away.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:28.270
Here.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.170
Someone gave you fabric
for women's clothing?

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.260
You didn't like it,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.920
yet you had clothes made from it?

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:53.450
Thank you.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.740
I used to think

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.430
people from Yao State

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.870
were all fierce, brutal,

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.250
savage, and strong.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:09.870
Now I see

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.730
they're just ordinary flesh and blood.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.260
Everyone in this world is the same,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.750
longing for a peaceful life

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.150
and tranquility.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.540
With such good days,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.570
why should we wage war?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.910
What you see

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.060
is a scene of peace,

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.160
but in the distant borders,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.220
many people can't even get enough to eat.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.390
Taijin

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.590
is rich in resources,

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.610
with all natural advantages.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.950
Yet your ruler

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.790
is incompetent and corrupt,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.000
squandering a prosperous land.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.840
Our Yao State suffers from harsh cold.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.800
If a natural disaster strikes,

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.560
with withered grass and smoke
over the cold land,

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.890
nine out of ten households would be empty.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.080
If our border could move a bit south,

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.560
there would be fertile land,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.390
and our people

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.010
could then live in peace and prosperity.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.040
But is what you're doing

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.320
truly for your people,

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.870
or for your private vendetta?

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.550
In your heart,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.850
you've always harbored hatred
for your brother's murder.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.450
That's why you hate my father

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:38.730
and Taijin

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.590
to the core.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.610
But think about it—

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.560
if one day Yao State builds up its army

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.150
and wages war again,

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.550
won't the ones suffering

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.190
be your own people?

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.330
Being born into a royal family

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.360
comes with many responsibilities

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:06.020
and burdens.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.590
As a general,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.790
you should understand these principles.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.110
The blood and sacrifices
of countless people

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.290
are reduced to just a few lines

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.990
in history books.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.960
One person's compassion

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.020
is truly too small a force.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.980
But sometimes I can't help but think

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.350
that if rulers

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.260
and the people

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.740
all voluntarily

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.870
uphold the hard-won peace,

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:40.200
then

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.030
the world could be free of war.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.760

You look somewhat similar to Jin'an.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.670
I'm glad

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.870
you came to see me.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.560
Jin'an used to love this piece
most of all.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.120
You can listen to it on behalf of him.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.040
Who are you really?

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.719
Prince Annan, why did you say that?

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.409
Have we met before in Taijin?

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.389
Back then,

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:47.830
who was I?

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.949
Since you've already forgotten,

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:56.010
why bother asking?

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.840
If you refuse to speak,

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.710
I'll kill all those brothers
you care about

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.950
one by one before your eyes,

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.060
until none remain.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:10.620
And then?

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.870
March south again

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.110
to slaughter the Central Plains?

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.370
Does war and bloodshed

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.270
bring you such pleasure?

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.770
Someone gave you
the Brain-Devouring Powder.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.960
As long as you poison me, you'd be safe.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.880
With so many chances, you never acted.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.580
That rainy night,
I fell asleep in front of you,

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.060
and you still didn't make a move.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:46.880
Since you know everything,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.310
why do you keep me by your side?

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:51.830
Why not just kill me?

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.180
I also want to know why!

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.750
Tell me.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.080
What exactly are your intentions
toward me?

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.980

Prince Annan.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.630
You want to see me?

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.910
You've been in charge of
the residence's security.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:45.750
Recently,

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:48.670
have you noticed anything suspicious?

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.460
Prince Annan,

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.540
I've sent men to patrol repeatedly

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.310
but found nothing

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.000
out of the ordinary.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.110
Then how did these things

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.760
appear before me?

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.150
Prince Annan,

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.710
I failed in my duties

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.870
and someone with ill intentions

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.160
took advantage of the situation.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.460
Please forgive me, Prince Annan!

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.060
I'll ask you one last time!

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.580
What exactly happened in Taijin?

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.920
What is my relationship with Li Shuang?

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.900
Speak.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.720
You've followed me for years.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.880
You should know my temper well.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.710
If you don't speak now,

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.180
I'll make sure you never can.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.790
It concerns our nation's fate.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.840
I cannot say.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.180
Prince Annan,

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.380
here is an urgent report from the front.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.350
Read it.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.460
Li Wei is leading troops

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.420
and will arrive

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.860
at our gates within half a day.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.970
He's also bringing

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.520
the Yao State prisoners
that Taijin refused to release before.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.380
Prince Annan,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.180
I am willing to be the vanguard

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.640
and drive the Taijin forces out
of Yao State.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.920
Li Wei's arrival may not necessarily
be an act of war.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:02.820
Issue my order:

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.350
all troops, take formation,

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.310
and whether we fight or not,

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.580
we must not lose the initiative.
