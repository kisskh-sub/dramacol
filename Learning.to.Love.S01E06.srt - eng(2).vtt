WEBVTT

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.242
The express train at platform one
is bound for Misakiguchi.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.779
After Shinagawa, the train will stop
at Keikyu Kamata station.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.525
- Wow, he's creepy!
- What is he doing?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.293
What a creep!

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:31.998
Hey! Here.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.367
And this way!

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.872
Quick, get on!

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.709
The doors are closing.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.516
Morning.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.086
Good morning.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.561
Thank you for taking the Keikyu line.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.896
What are you doing?

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.498
What?

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.867
You look good.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.540
You didn't skip today.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.442
Why would I?

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.976
It's our goodbye trip.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.680
I asked for my first day off, ever.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.948
Did you take a day off?

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.250
It's not a workday for me today.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.054
Aomono-Yokocho station!

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.958
I used to go to the shopping street here!

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.259
Can we see it?

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.031
This is my first school trip.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.572
- First time ever?
- Yeah.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.441
Not even a camping trip.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.747
I actually didn't like
going on school trips.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:58.818
I was a slow eater, and we had to write
a short essay afterwards.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.020
Really? That sounds awful.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:01.921
It was!

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.756
But you will need to write one today.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.258
- What?
- A short essay.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.365
I didn't like writing it
because I felt pressured to say I had fun.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.300
You can write whatever.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.002
Miss, did you know

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.307
that whenever
the Keikyu line train turns, it creaks!

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.677
Kind of like a squeaking sound!

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.980
Squeak and boom!

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.948
Squeak! Do you get it?

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.550
Have a listen!

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.519
Listen, it's coming.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.854
See? Listen.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.057
I think I'm starting to…

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.793
hate you!

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.481
Me too.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.751
I hate you too.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.629
This is it for us, right?

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.670
You have a perfect fiancé
who's well-suited for you.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.674
I'll keep having fake relationships
based on money.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.276
It fits me perfectly.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.112
See? It fits perfectly!

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.049
Hey!

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:39.118
I want a day with you.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.122
A day?

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.891
Let's go somewhere together.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.394
Like a school trip.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.631
After that, we can end this.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.600
A school trip?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.301
Yeah.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.137
I know where we can go.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:19.726
EXPRESS TRAIN TO MISAKIGUCHI

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.398
Hey, what on earth?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.003
Sorry. I was out drinking
until 3:00 a.m. with a customer.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.306
You were having fun
with one of your princesses, huh?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.041
It's part of my job.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.026
Ouch!

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:53.926
How ridiculous!

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.428
Act your age!

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.263
- Honestly!
- Weirdos!

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.965
- Unbelievable!
- So embarrassing!

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.401
- I can't even look!
- You're in a public space!

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.469
Stop flirting in public!

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.439
- She's copying him!
- Too good!

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.540
That's the face!

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.942
We are soon stopping at Miura Beach.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.079
This is Miura Beach.
Please exit from the left-hand side.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:18.818
Hurry, hurry!

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.155
- The weird couple got off too!
- Bye!

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:25.124
This feels amazing!

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.759
The air's different here!

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:27.694
Wow!

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.030
- I can see the beach! Let's go!
- Well, we are at Miura Beach…

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:31.931
Wait!

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.100
By the way, where shall we go?

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.135
There's a shrine and a marina!

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:39.639
A shrine sounds good!
It'll feel like a real school trip.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.841
We can get information at the bus stop.

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:44.243
Wow! What's going on?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.746
- Please ask the staff for help.
- Take the ticket!

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.314
Huh? I thought I could make it.

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:49.382
- What?
- Huh?

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.583
- This way!
- No!

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.052
- Get back.
- I'd never bought a ticket before!

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.588
- Look, it's open!
- No, you can't go through!

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:58.291
You're too slow! Come on!

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.494
I won't last all day
if I use too much energy now.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.162
Go on! You got this!

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.164
Do you want to hold my hand?

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:08.901
It was your fault
that we missed that bus, you know!

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.303
That's nice!

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.207
It was my fault!

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.676
Wow!

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.946
Here you go.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.348
Thank you.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.183
You're so thoughtful.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.819
Well, having nice skin
is important for being a host.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.621
- So it's for you?
- Yeah.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.458
Wait, hang on.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.063
SLIDE TO TURN OFF

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.568
SLIDE TO TURN OFF

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.276
The last day has started.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:54.013
Couples usually share an umbrella
on a rainy day,

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:58.184
but blocking the sun made
more sense for our relationship.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.593
It says Kainan Shrine.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.861
I see…

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.463
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What?

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.831
Get back.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.333
You have to bow first.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.704
- You need to face that way.
- Oh, this way.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.442
Yeah! This feels so good!

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.843
- No! Stop!
- What?

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.611
You can't do that!

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.613
I'm sorry.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.856
Hang on.

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:39.358
It's two bows, two claps,
and then another bow.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.293
What do you mean?

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:46.065
Put them together properly
and then make a wish.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.869
Another bow at the end.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.374
Well done.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.877
Why so bossy?

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:01.981
Let's take this opportunity
to write down our wishes!

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.951
Wishes? I don't have any!

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.122
This is cute.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.093
What did you write?

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.931
Third year…

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.566
What's this kanji?

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:22.635
- Hollyhock Class.
- Okay.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:23.803
It's my homeroom class.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:29.008
Under that, it says,
"I hope everyone passes the exam."

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.011
Okay. Me too, then.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.047
Yes.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.082
Good.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:37.650
Like this.

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.653
No.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.922
Think about the stroke order.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.291
I forgot about the stroke order.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.659
The "tree" part…

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.728
A diagonal line…

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.530
- And then, "mouth"…
- Straight.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.265
Slow and steady.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:54.834
There!

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:56.435
Well done, it looks good.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.037
- And my name.
- Yes.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.207
It's so narrow.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.843
Dot.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.045
- Write slowly.
- I'll be fine!

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.080
- Slowly.
- Line here, and then here.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.749
{\an8}TAIGA TAKAMORI

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.684
Yes! All done!

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.953
It looks great!

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.691
A pass in what?

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:21.794
Everything.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.199
You're good at writing your name.

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:29.969
{\an8}Especially the dots in this kanji.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.604
They're perfectly balanced.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.339
Yeah, right!

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.941
Right, let's hang them!

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.750
"For everyone to pass," huh?

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.153
You're a good teacher.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.755
No, I'm not.

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:51.791
My students don't like me.

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.093
So, I wanted to write it
without them knowing.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.562
They don't like you? Why?

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.699
I know. You hit them too often?

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.302
It's a girls' school!
I barely even get angry at them.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.440
I make an effort to make
the classes interesting and…

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:10.876
I try to treat them all equally,
but they still don't like me.

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.414
{\an8}- I WANT TO PASS TOO
- I HOPE EVERYONE PASSES

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:21.354
{\an8}Wow! Okay, please come forward.

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.390
{\an8}I'll pick you next.
We have many more to go!

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.325
{\an8}- Geez! Look!
- Be patient, okay?

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:27.960
{\an8}Wow, how stunning!

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.229
{\an8}It's gorgeous!

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.932
I'm so thirsty!

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.767
Yeah, me too.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.603
- Ta-da!
- Wow! What is it?

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.513
Here you go.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.914
Thanks.

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:52.885
This is great! It's so cold!

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.720
I put it in the freezer.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:58.491
As I was leaving, I was asked
where I was going because of it.

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:00.226
You said "on a date with a host"?

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:01.661
I could never!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.004
You'll spill it.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.610
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.184
You got it wrong.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.020
What happened?

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.355
- This side?
- What?

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.223
No!

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:32.892
- Not that!
- What?

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.327
What you said about your students.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.097
I think…

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:42.435
Maybe they don't like you
because you treat everyone fairly.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.572
When I had just become a host,

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:50.376
I thought I needed to treat
all customers fairly.

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:56.816
Then, no one gets upset with you,
but you also don't get nominated much.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:02.354
So my boss told me,
"You need some contrast!"

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.825
And I wasn't quite sure what he meant.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.730
But I decided to just be aggressive
with those who seemed to like me,

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.966
and didn't give much attention
to the others.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.669
And I suddenly became popular.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:18.971
How come?

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.842
The ones who get
special treatment love it.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:27.313
The ones who don't
start to want special treatment.

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.216
I see.

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:33.953
I don't exactly know why,

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:39.592
but I think people who are nice
to everyone seem fake.

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.496
I think you're right.

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:47.066
I was trying so hard not to be disliked.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:53.506
But who am I to say?
I never went to school, so what do I know?

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.041
Did you want to go?

00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.879
Sorry, did I upset you?

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.080
No, it's just…

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:07.419
You're the first person to ask me
if I wanted to go to school.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.558
I always got told,

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.361
"Go to school!"

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.496
"You'll fall behind!"

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:20.633
"You won't make friends!",
"You won't go to high school!"

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.535
Nothing but threats.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:24.503
I see…

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.705
But…

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:29.375
I actually really wanted to go.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.579
That's why I couldn't go.

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.149
Doesn't make sense, does it?

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.451
I think I get it.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.858
You wanted to have fun at school,

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:51.030
but you couldn't go
because you knew it was impossible?

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.201
Miss.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.038
Why do you understand me so well?

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.775
Let's all go together!

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.276
Okay!

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.146
Take your water with you!

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.482
What are you doing?

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.388
Me! I know! Pick me!

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.656
Go ahead, Takamori.

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:20.860
Exactly!
This is what I wanted to do in school!

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:25.030
Raise my hand faster than anyone,
answer correctly, and look cool!

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:28.000
My classmates would say,
"Wow, you're awesome!"

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:31.103
And the teacher would praise me, too!

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.371
And all the girls

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:35.975
would look at me with hearts in their eyes
and tell me how amazing I am!

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.246
Who am I kidding?

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:43.349
It's so lame.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.684
Not attractive at all.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.186
Takamori!

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.555
You shouldn't sit on desks.

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:52.157
LET'S LEARN ABOUT THE OCEAN AND FOREST

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.195
It's not lame at all.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:03.969
Okay. In that case,
tell me something lame about you.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:07.006
Me? Everything about me is lame.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.741
Yeah, I know, but…

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:14.780
Tell me the lamest thing you've ever done!
The worst of the worst!

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:18.651
Well…

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:24.089
I guess it has to be about my dating life.

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:26.558
Here we go.

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:33.032
I got so possessive of someone once
that I basically became a detective.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:36.035
I wanted to know what he was doing 24/7.

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.971
So I checked his phone
and even stalked him.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.141
He got annoyed, and he began to hate me.

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:45.678
He told me to kill myself.

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:48.380
What?

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.684
That's awful!

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.520
I mean, it's so childish!

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:57.456
There are countless better ways
to break up with women.

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:02.828
That's not the lamest thing
I've done, it's what came after that!

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:05.331
Alright! Here we go!

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:09.168
After he told me to kill myself,
I jumped into the sea to drown.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:16.175
It was so dark and suffocating
that after 30 seconds

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.978
I started screaming,
"Help! I don't want to die!"

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:23.949
What do you think? Extremely lame, right?

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.487
Yeah, that's pretty lame.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.189
I think you win.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:36.328
- Were you able to catch a lot of fish?
- Yes!

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.964
- We need to go!
- What?

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.701
Once you're back in your seats,
please drink some water, okay?

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:45.237
- Your bag!
- Okay!

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.573
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.942
- Hi.
- I'm sorry for intruding!

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.545
- Not at all! Would you like to join us?
- No, thank you.

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:56.382
- We have seats!
- No, it's okay! Thank you.

00:16:58.417 --> 00:16:59.685
Back to your seats!

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.761
I'd never told anyone
that part of the story.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:13.332
Him laughing it off, made me feel
light physically and mentally.

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:18.937
Before I knew it,
I had forgotten that it was our last day.

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.077
This looks great.

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:27.079
- It smells great, too!
- Right?

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:33.352
I'm so hungry!

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:37.289
- Nice.
- Welcome!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.558
- Have a seat here!
- Thank you.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.429
- Welcome!
- Hi.

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:49.601
Let me pay. I'm older than you.

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:53.338
But I want to show off! As a man.

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:57.409
- That's kind of old-fashioned.
- Really?

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:00.345
All my princesses love it when I pay.

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.980
I see, that's nice.

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:04.650
Ms. Chihuahua, don't sulk!

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:07.453
This is the menu. Help yourself to water!

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.787
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:11.857
{\an8}SEAFOOD RICE BOWL, SEAFOOD CURRY,
SASHIMI SET, TOASTED SANDWICH

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.629
Handwritten menus can be hard to read.

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:21.100
Excuse me. What do you recommend?

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:24.169
The seafood rice bowl and seafood curry!

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.472
- Seafood rice bowl, please!
- Okay.

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:28.173
- Curry for me, please.
- Sure!

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.909
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did.

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:39.284
Like that and then…

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.788
Shall we ask for something to write?

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:43.989
What?

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.725
This symbolizes water…

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.563
{\an8}And then there's a hair ornament
on top of the kanji for mother.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.967
Wow. How can you write
so neatly upside down?

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:02.274
Learning the origin of the kanji
helps you remember them.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.711
But why is there the word
for mother in "ocean"?

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.215
I don't see the connection
between the ocean and a mother.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.621
It's because the ocean
is where everything flows into.

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:20.859
Soil, trees, remains of animals,
trash produced by humans.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:26.031
The ocean accepts everything
just like a mother does.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:30.602
Not all mothers are like that though.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.071
My mom's the opposite.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:37.276
She's the one who scatters trash.

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:41.046
But your mom seemed so happy
to see you the other day!

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.081
Because I'm a money tree.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.785
- That's sad.
- I don't care.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.254
She dates different guys one after another

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.857
and doesn't even tell me who my dad is.

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.193
Thanks.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:59.131
You must be curious who your dad is.

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.400
Not really.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:05.070
I bet he's a good-for-nothing anyway.

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:09.374
He's probably an insignificant person
unlike your dad.

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:12.911
My dad might be
an important person at work,

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.347
but he's just
an old-fashioned tyrant at home.

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.549
He's super unkind to my mom,

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.752
and he only respects successful people.

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:25.090
Sometimes I wish I had a kinder dad
who would listen to me.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.860
I wouldn't care if we didn't have money.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:35.434
If you really were poor,
you would never say that.

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.770
Rich people often say things like that.

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:44.476
It's like they're looking down
from above a garbage dump, saying,

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:49.514
"I'd like to see
what it's like down there once."

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:55.287
"I wonder how it smells.
I bet it smells, but I'm just curious!"

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:05.163
Oh, can I order a draft beer, please?

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.666
- Two, please.
- Sure!

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:24.016
Time to time, you shut yourself off
all of a sudden like that.

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:29.554
I don't know what you have
gone through in life.

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.157
I can never know.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:36.161
But I've never pitied you.

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:40.098
You are so much stronger than I am
and much more mature!

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:44.002
- So stop acting like a child and--
- Are you lecturing me?

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:46.772
So annoying…

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.177
We're never going to meet again,
so let's just have fun, okay?

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:56.248
I'm telling you now
because it's my last chance to tell you.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:22:02.454
Do you think that you can change me
or something?

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:04.823
It's impossible.

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:11.463
Not everyone can succeed in things
no matter how hard you try.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.764
That's not true!

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:15.834
I think you can do
whatever you want if you try.

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:17.669
- Which is why…
- Here we go!

00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:23.342
- Your son's very handsome.
- What?

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.344
Son?

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.246
I'm joking.

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:31.016
Lucky you to have such a young boyfriend!

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:32.784
- He's not my--
- Yes, I am.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:36.621
But we're here to talk
about ending the relationship.

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.256
Really?

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:42.394
I guess the age gap can be troublesome,
but you can make it work!

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.730
We used to fight constantly,
but we're good now.

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:45.864
- Kinu!
- Yes?

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:48.100
Stop being nosy! Food's ready.

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:50.802
Can't tell who's older, right?

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:57.275
Cheers!

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.878
I guess not.

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:06.017
What?

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:07.986
A firework display?

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.054
FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:10.088
It's today!

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:11.223
No way!

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:14.860
{\an8}- That was in 2019…
- Oh, that festival?

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:18.697
They haven't brought it back since COVID.
Here's your seafood curry!

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:21.500
- And your seafood rice bowl!
- Thank you.

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:26.638
If they bring it back in the future,
can I come here to see it?

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.473
Of course!

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.942
I will be by myself then, though.

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:35.680
- A fireworks display we can never see.
- Thanks.

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:39.317
- I wish I hadn't seen the poster.
- Oh, it's hot!

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:41.420
Ouch!

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.558
- Wow, that's hot!
- Hey, it's mine!

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.360
Can't I try it?

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.167
We have some
newly released machines today.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:59.571
If you'd like to play them,
please ask one of the staff members.

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.943
Are you playing them one by one?

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:09.347
No, just keep the knob twisted
the whole time!

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:11.850
Don't twist it too far!

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.252
- Your personality is showing.
- What?

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:18.123
About this much.

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:20.792
That's it.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.727
- See?
- Oh!

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.696
- Yes! Okay.
- Keep your hand on it!

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:26.665
- Yes!
- Don't you let go of it!

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:28.066
Roger that!

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.801
- Try aiming here. Good!
- I hit it!

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:31.036
Right here. Okay?

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:32.804
Looking good!

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.407
Keep going, Miss!

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:38.009
You're getting better!

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:42.147
I love you.

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:46.218
I don't want to go home.

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.188
Yes! Keep going!

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:52.591
FOUR YEN BALL X 27

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.229
Here, take one.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:24:59.231
- Can I have two?
- Rules are rules.

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:01.366
You're right.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.239
Thank you so much.

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:10.542
Wait, miss!

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:16.381
27 BALLS - 52 BALLS

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.282
Really?

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:18.850
Please take another one.

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:20.685
- But that's--
- Just take one.

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.121
Thank you!

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.267
NEW MACHINE DEBUT

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:07.999
Huh?

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:26.484
Strange…

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.756
It was nice to have someone
looking for me.

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:38.263
I just wanted
to secretly follow him forever.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.973
You're not very good at this.
Did you panic?

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:24.576
- Not at all!
- Hmm?

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.344
- Let go of me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:29.848
- Hey, can you please--
- Did you panic when you lost sight of me?

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:32.751
I did.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:35.253
Good.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.959
Here. I got prizes for both of us.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:41.960
Wow!

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:44.162
Thank you.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.602
I left my UV umbrella!

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:53.304
At the restaurant?

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:55.874
Never mind.

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.043
Instead of an umbrella…

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:09.587
- I don't think this suits me.
- Hang on.

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.157
How about this?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.995
That's it!

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:18.863
I think so.

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:20.565
What about you?

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:22.500
- Hats don't suit me.
- Come on!

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.704
It doesn't look that bad.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:30.341
Okay, maybe not this one but…

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.243
How about this one?

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.547
You look like a kid!

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.317
Now you look old!

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.586
- Give me a break!
- Not that you're old!

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.456
Your head looks big in this one.

00:28:44.522 --> 00:28:46.057
The hat's too small!

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:46.958
There!

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:50.095
Stop being so mean!

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:53.698
You can stop laughing, too!

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.268
This is the one!

00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:01.406
See? It looks so good on you.

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:05.610
Excuse me. Can we buy these?

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:06.911
Sure thing!

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:09.781
Give me one second.

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:12.350
- What?
- Excuse me.

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.993
I'm guessing it's just past 4:00 p.m.

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:23.762
You can tell?

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:27.632
I can tell from how low the tide is.

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:33.705
Whenever my mom brought me here,

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:37.909
she told me I needed
to wait until 5:00 p.m.

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:46.618
And I waited patiently for her.

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:49.721
I see.

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:00.565
- Do it with me.
- What?

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:16.815
Sit here.

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:19.250
Thank you so much.

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:28.793
Can school trips last until the evening?

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:31.963
Not usually, no.

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.068
Before we part…

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:42.040
Do you want to write a short essay
about this trip?

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:03.995
I'll write it here.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.870
Like this?

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:14.205
A line here and straight…

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.908
Straight…

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.881
Wait. Hang on.

00:31:22.947 --> 00:31:24.983
What's next?

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.739
And then to the left, I think?

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:52.877
Done!

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:56.147
TAKE CARE MISS

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:06.758
You should add some punctuation marks.

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:18.303
- Makes sense.
- Yeah?

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.607
- This is called a comma.
- Okay.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.542
It means the sentence will continue.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.044
- A comma.
- Yes.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.748
TAKE CARE, MISS.

00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:32.483
This is a period.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.086
- A period.
- It marks the end of a sentence.

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:42.327
So we're putting a period
on our relationship after today?

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.664
Yes.

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.237
{\an8}I had so much fun!

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.541
{\an8}My first ever date.

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:59.043
{\an8}First ever?

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.879
{\an8}- There's no way!
- It's true!

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:06.985
{\an8}I've met so many women in my life,
but I've never been on a date.

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:09.887
I'm honored.

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.423
Hard to believe, huh?

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:16.894
I've dined with over a hundred women,

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:18.629
had drinks with them,

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:21.833
and kissed them.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.440
Which is why I won't kiss you.

00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.911
My lips are filthy.

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:36.447
- Super gross.
- That's not true!

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:38.383
It's okay.

00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:39.917
I've accepted myself.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.955
{\an8}I'd say anything to increase my sales.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:52.430
{\an8}"Wow! You are especially cute today!
Your lips are so plump!"

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:56.801
{\an8}"I know, let's make this
a special evening for us."

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.604
{\an8}"I dreamt about you last night."

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:05.777
{\an8}"There's a new restaurant
that I want to go to with you!

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:09.347
{\an8}Shall we go now? Or maybe tomorrow?"

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:17.088
{\an8}"If you'll buy me some champagne,
I can spend the night with you!

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:20.958
Because I have to reciprocate your love!"

00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:25.997
Why are you crying?

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:29.267
I know it's weird.

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:31.803
Were you moved by my performance?

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:33.604
I'm sorry, I don't even know why!

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:49.554
Miss.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.323
Want to run away with me?

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.161
An escape?

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:05.303
We can move to an unknown town
and live in a shabby apartment together.

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.506
Does it have to be shabby?

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.075
I'm a bit of a neat freak.

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:12.810
We won't have a choice!

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:16.981
You'll lose your job
because you ran off with a stupid host,

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:22.653
be disowned by your rich parents,
abandoned by your wonderful fiancé.

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:29.393
I will also be sacked from the club
and won't be able to pay my debts.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.129
So we have to run away.

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:36.267
We'll need to get part-time jobs
to make money!

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:39.470
You're right.

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:44.842
I know, you can work
as a cashier at a supermarket.

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.746
And I can work at a construction site.

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.316
Are you sure? You'll get beaten up
for using a UV umbrella!

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:54.085
I'll have no choice!

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.855
The neighbors will be so suspicious.

00:35:57.922 --> 00:36:02.326
"The woman's so much older.
Are they a couple or…"

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.396
"Maybe they are criminals on the run!"

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:10.234
People will gossip,
and they'll start throwing stones at us.

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:13.704
Even the dogs in the neighborhood
will start barking at us!

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.875
That sounds like a terrible escape!

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:21.279
But it'll be fun!

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:29.453
I'm sure that terrible would be fun.

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:46.804
I told you, I won't kiss you.

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.940
Yes. Sorry.

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:17.368
A train is approaching.

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:21.639
Please stand behind the yellow line.

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:24.709
You should go first.

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:29.614
I'll take the next train.

00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:45.730
- Let's say goodbye now.
- What?

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.402
The doors are closing.

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.139
Okay.

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.245
Take care.

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:04.782
- You too.
- Yeah.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.224
Go ahead.

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:19.063
- I will.
- Okay.

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:24.135
Go already!

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.275
I know.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.546
Let's turn around…

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.716
at the same time.

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:12.683
Okay.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.585
No looking back, okay?

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.754
Okay.

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.026
Ready? Go!

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:55.326
Miss!

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:59.423
{\an8}MIURA BEACH

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.120
MISSED CALLS

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.289
What on earth…

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.290
What?

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:08.425
Reality came crashing down on me.

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:13.130
The school called so many times.

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:17.201
Did you not go
with Mr. Kawahara to Miura Beach?

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:26.243
{\an8}We received a call from a parent asking
about your relationship with the host.

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:29.346
{\an8}Ms. Sawaguchi saw you
with him at the school gate.

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.727
{\an8}Kaoru from THE JOKER.

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:48.933
{\an8}Who are you?

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:52.469
{\an8}I'm Manami Ogawa's fiancé.

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:03.480
Why are you here?

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:09.453
Manami’s mother said
she was at Miura Beach, so I waited here.

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:14.491
Because I am her fiancé.

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:18.128
Yeah, you already told me.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:26.804
Was it fun to steal
and toy with another man's woman?

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.308
Toy with?

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.078
It's not like that.

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:35.179
No.

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.748
You were together all day.

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:40.651
You expect me to believe nothing happened?

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.254
Hey.

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.291
You're sounding like a jerk right now.

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:50.127
It's called seductive marketing, right?

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:52.630
To make them pay more at the club,

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:55.833
you use sweet talk
to make them fall for you,

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.337
and make them obsessed through sex.

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.574
You're disgusting.

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:04.475
What?

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:08.746
Your fiancé isn't that type of woman.

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:11.148
What do you know?

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:14.118
- All you think about is money!
- Yeah, so what?

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:18.022
I am a host through and through.

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:20.824
I'll do anything
to make my princesses happy.

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:25.029
Perhaps I can teach you a few things?

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.534
Hey!

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.369
Here!

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:53.390
Ouch.

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:06.203
Love is like a sweet dream.

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:09.306
{\an8}Hello? It's Ogawa!

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.709
{\an8}I'm so sorry! I'll head there right away!

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:21.752
{\an8}Love makes people do stupid things.

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:27.624
{\an8}Can you open the door?

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:30.360
{\an8}There you go.

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:32.062
{\an8}- Thanks!
- I'll take that.

00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:34.298
{\an8}The wind is so strong!

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:35.699
{\an8}- Hey, Kinu.
- What?

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.167
{\an8}I think someone forgot that.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.238
{\an8}It's that couple's!

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.207
{\an8}Oh, yeah.

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:46.276
{\an8}They'll come and get it someday.

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:55.152
{\an8}TAKE CARE, MISS.

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:02.192
Is it true that you're dating
a host from Kabukicho?

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.161
I had actually fallen for him.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.796
Kaoru is hospitalized.

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:06.864
Hospitalized?

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.899
Don't call me anymore, okay? Bye.

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:13.904
{\an8}THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:14.972
