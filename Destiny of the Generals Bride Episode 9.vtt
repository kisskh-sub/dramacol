=Episode 9=

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.920
Nan Jiang, it's a little chilly.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.280
Get me a robe.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.120
Nan Jiang,

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.159
do you think I made the right decision?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.880
She is my sister, after all.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:37.719
Who's your sister?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.799
Do you remember

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.280
what you told me last night?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.200
What?

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:10.400
Nothing.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.920
You're my wife now.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.519
You don't have to be
so reserved around me.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.959
I'm your wife now.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.319
So, does Su Hua

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:27.200
still have a place in your heart?

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.560
You're quite good

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.159
at styling women's hair.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.280
Before,

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.879
I only ever did Su Hua's hair.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.280
If you style my hair,

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.520
Miss Su won't be upset

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.680
or refuse to see you, will she?

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.360
Didn't you say?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.599
If she wants to see me,

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.879
she'll show up on her own.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.879
No matter.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.800
I'll wait.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.360
If she doesn't want to see me,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.319
there must be a reason.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.080
I'll wait until the day

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.680
she's ready to see me.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.680
I still have things to handle
in the army.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:05.960
I'll be going now.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.120
If you need anything,

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.159
come find me at the office.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.879
This is my own business.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.400
I don't want to trouble you.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.800
I told you already,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.319
it's no trouble at all.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:44.280
Nan Jiang,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960
did I say anything

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.520
I shouldn't have last night?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.759
You were asleep
the entire time I was here.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.479
After nightfall,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.120
General sent me away

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.960
and watched over you alone.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.719
Nan Jiang.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.080
Could he have figured out
who I really am?

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.520
I'm not sure.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.080
Hua,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.360
you always say that victims
shouldn't blame themselves

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.680
for what happened.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.560
I understand
you want to take revenge alone.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.079
But why must you

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
hide your identity?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.199
Wouldn't it be better
to patch things up

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.319
with General

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.560
and get revenge together?

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.079
Nan Jiang,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.199
we live in a world

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.240
where a woman's worth
is judged by her purity.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.480
You can't trust a person's heart.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.720
Xiao Yun once loved me.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.759
But he also turned his back on me

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.720
when he had to save the princess.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.319
I don't dare to gamble,

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.079
and I don't want to take that risk.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.319
What if he won't mind?

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.720
What if he will mind?

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.079
I'm done giving anyone the chance

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.480
to break my heart.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.680
The women sold by Xiao Ye

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.120
usually get beaten up first,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.199
then drugged into silence.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.959
He says once they're hurt enough,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.720
they'll be too scared to resist.

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.639
Sent to a new place,

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.000
they'll learn to behave.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.920
But these injuries are hard to heal.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.920
I went through a lot

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.920
to treat my wounds.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.879
You…

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.160
You're Su Hua?

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.480
How do you know?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.319
I handle the finances

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.000
for the women Xiao Ye sells.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.560
I know where they're sent

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.680
and how much money

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:12.319
they fetch.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.079
I'd heard

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.879
General was fond
of a merchant's daughter.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.000
When he married you,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.040
I thought to myself,

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.360
men can be so heartless.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:29.800
Now that I think about it,

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.680
only if you are Su Hua,

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.319
does it all make sense.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.879
Madam, what was your purpose in marrying

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:42.920
into the Xiao family?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.600
Revenge.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:52.800
What about you, Yun Juan?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.600
Don't you want revenge?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.519
I…

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.000
Yun Juan.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.720
No matter what's happened,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.759
no matter what you've been through,

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:08.199
it's all in the past.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.680
Whether you choose revenge

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.120
or not,

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:17.759
you should live well

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.160
and live for yourself.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.360
What's this?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.680
Every woman who passes through

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.920
is recorded in the ledger.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.439
Madam,

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.279
I'm not capable of revenge.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.279
I just want to live.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.600
This is the best I can do,

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.600
for you,

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.680
for the other women,

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.399
and for the me I used to be.

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:24.920
Please order whatever you like.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.319
Madam.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.600
Don't fuss.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:31.879
I just came

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.039
to see how you've been lately.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.120
My life may be tough,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.000
but at least I don't have
to answer to any man.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.320
I'm free to follow my own wishes.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.799
Yun Juan.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.679
Life outside isn't like
life in the residence.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:46.720
Madam,

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.519
you already helped me buy my freedom

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:49.799
and pulled me out of the fire.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.120
I'm free now.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.200
I can't accept this money from you.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.000
My little noodle stall

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:57.360
doesn't make much,

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:59.799
but I can feed my family and keep us

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.799
from going hungry.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.320
Seeing you like this

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.519
puts my mind at ease.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.440
I'll come back to visit in a few days.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.480
Next time,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.960
you have to try my cooking.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120
Of course.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.279
I'm off.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:14.879
All right.

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:17.919
Take care, Madam.

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:25.840
Yun Juan.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.799
Learned any new dishes recently?

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.600
Make us something.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:30.480
That's right.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.120
Where are you going?

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:39.240
Everyone, we're closed. Please leave.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.600
Where to? My place?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.360
Second Master,

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:44.519
I'm no longer

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:45.600
a servant of the Xiao Residence.

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:46.519
Let me go!

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.879
Yun Juan,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.679
they say a day as husband and wife
lasts a hundred days of grace.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.120
We've spent so much time together.

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.919
Don't you think

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.879
pushing me away now is a bit cruel?

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.960
Second Master said

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:03.240
there's a red mole
at the base of her thigh.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.159
Come on,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.600
show us.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.000
Yun Juan.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:11.279
That day at the Xiao Residence,

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.200
you climbed into my bed
without any hesitation.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.679
You…

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.799
Why bother putting up an act of chastity now?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.480
That's right.

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:17.840
Drop the act.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.799
Come home with us.
