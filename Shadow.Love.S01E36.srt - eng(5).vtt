[Episode 36]

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.010
That day in the golden palace,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.560
why did you admit to being
the man in black?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.030
When Qin questioned me,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530
many images flashed through my mind.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.030
Those images told me

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.750
that I am the man in black.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.200
What else do you remember?

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.120
It's okay.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.570
Let bygones be bygones.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.470
Never mind.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.510
I remember I fell in love

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.840
with a woman in Taijin.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.430
You are the Prince Annan of Yao State.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.400
Falling in love with a woman from Taijin

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.079
will not end well.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.730
What if I were not the Prince Annan?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.750
Prince Annan, may I ask you

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.660
where Empress Dowager Qin is now?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.590
She drank the Double-Blossom Wine
with my brother.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.800
So we can't hurt her,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.630
but lock her up in the Imperial Prison.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.800
May I see her?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.150
Let me out.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.910
Let me out!

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.030
I want to see Yu.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.870
Free me!

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.490
I knew

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.210
that Duan Aodeng would eventually
make his move.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.360
Did he

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.100
send you over to finish me?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.730
The grudges within your Yao State

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.089
have nothing to do with me.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.070
I'm just here to see

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.040
the person
responsible for my father's death.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.160
I'm satisfied to see you

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.020
live worse than death.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.050
You think I'm the one
who killed your father?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.490
You're wrong.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.890
It was Duan Aodeng.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.590
If he hadn't repeatedly stood in my way

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.870
and messed with me,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920
it wouldn't have come to this point.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.870
And you!

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.000
If you hadn't been so soft-hearted

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.680
for a man,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.320
your father wouldn't have had to come
all this way to die.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.800
You brought it all

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.830
upon yourself.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.210
You schemed meticulously

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.160
and did so much,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.300
yet look at your miserable state now.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.980
Was it worth it?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.040
When I was 17,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.930
I saw Honey for the first time.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480
That day,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.740
he came in person to propose to my sister.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.360
I hid behind a rockery,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.270
taking a peek at him.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.600
Just one peek,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.230
and my heart had no room
for anyone else after that.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.830
I knelt in the ancestral hall
for five whole days,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.450
begging my parents to let me marry him

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.310
even as a concubine.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.270
For him, I kept lowering myself.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.310
I was even willing to give up

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.370
my reputation and dignity as a woman.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.040
But why couldn't he

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.680
show me

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.750
even a little bit of love?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.360
Since he doesn't love me,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.510
I'd rather make him hate me instead.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.900
Having drunk
the Double-Blossom Wine with him,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.409
you hold his life in your hands now.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.350
If you were truly so resentful,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.190
why wouldn't you just end your life?

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.040
This way, you could take him with you
to the grave.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.800
I've thought about it,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.110
but I can't die.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.950
I still have Yu.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.480
My boy.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.680
I beg you.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.870
Please take me to see Yu.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.920
Yu is too young

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.480
to lose me, his mother.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.410
I'm begging you.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.930
Please take me to see Yu.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.720
You've gone to such lengths

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.990
to ruin your life for
someone who doesn't love you.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.560
Your husband,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.190
your son,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.550
and everyone else you care about

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.630
will enjoy their lives peacefully

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.830
under the sun,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.720
slowly getting rid

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.870
of the shadow inside.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.720
But you

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.190
will end up being forgotten by everyone

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.070
and living a wretched life

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.480
in this dark dungeon.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.680
You have no right to judge me!

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.240
You're no better than me.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.000
Your beloved Jin'an

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.840
has forgotten you, hasn't he?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.330
All grudges and bonds have to end someday.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.390
He and I are even now.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.350
Since he's forgotten me,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600
I'll let go.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.510
At least

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.789
he once loved me deeply.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.440
But you

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.600
have never been loved.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.270
You must continue to survive

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.670
right here,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.670
living a long, long life

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.390
with all your sins.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.480
Because only this way

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.870
can you pay for my father's death.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.850
This leg's been injured for too long.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.400
I'm afraid it's impossible

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.660
for you to stand again.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.670
This doesn't matter much to me.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.240
It's just that whenever I go out,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.810
I'll need them to push my wheelchair.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.460
They're the ones who will suffer.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.600
Your Majesty, we have long been blessed
by your grace before.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.150
Now,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.670
being able to serve at your side again
is our greatest fortune.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.390
From now on,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.790
we will serve you wholeheartedly

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.190
without any complaints!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.890
You may rise now.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.140
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.530
You're truly a good emperor

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.200
who cares about your servants.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.720
Seems like saving you was the right call.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.120
But in the future,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.630
can you discipline your younger brother

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.080
and stop him from waging wars recklessly

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.320
for the peace
of the people from both states?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.650
Miss Lu, aren't you from Wuling Mountain?

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.270
How can you be so impertinent

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.660
when speaking to His Majesty?

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.270
Miss Lu, I will carefully consider

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.630
what you said.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.150
Aodeng,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.080
you really need

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.160
to do something about your bad temper.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.600
His Majesty needs rest.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.520
Sir and miss,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.860
may we talk in private?

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.510
How is my brother's condition?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.480
There's no antidote
to the Double-Blossom Wine.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.270
I'm afraid

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.870
you can't kill that woman.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.470
As for His Majesty's health,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.820
he just needs a gradual recovery.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.800
You two saved my brother's life.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.790
I can't express my gratitude enough
for your great favor.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.990
If you ever need anything in the future,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.970
I will do my utmost to repay you.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.240
No need to help him up.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.120
He's right.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.390
We indeed have done him a great favor.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.200
Moreover,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.980
he's got more than one life-saving favor

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.080
to be grateful for.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.800
Having survived to see your brother again,

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.310
you still owe a debt of gratitude

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.580
to someone besides us.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.410
Mr. Mo,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.060
you come and go freely
in the Yao State's imperial palace

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.300
as if it's your place.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.630
I suppose

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.910
the one
who trespassed into my mansion last time

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.670
was also you.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.600
Just some paintings copied from elsewhere.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.480
Prince Annan,

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.270
if you like them, just take a look.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.100
If not,

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.630
feel free to tear them up.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.750
But some paintings

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.870
are already engraved in one's heart

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.080
and cannot be destroyed.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.030
He's really stubborn.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.090
I thought he had recalled something.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.630
He's definitely remembered

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.910
a lot more

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.370
than you think.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.480
From when we met him again

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.870
in the court

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.320
until just now,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.150
have you

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:19.870
or I

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.080
ever mentioned our names to him?

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.870
"Mr. Mo."

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.870
"Miss Lu."

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.870
Then why didn't he admit it?

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.570
Everyone in the mundane world

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.030
has their own struggles.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.150
Let it be.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.670
You've just started feeling better,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.630
yet you're already
reviewing so many memorials.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.200
You should avoid overexertion

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.460
and get some good rest.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.840
That's why I need you

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.390
to share my burden.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.520
Servants, you may leave.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.630
The officials have been requesting

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.090
to execute the Taijin General, Li Shuang,
as soon as possible.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.920
Li Wei was sent over
to negotiate peace,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.560
but ended up being shot dead

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.840
by our troops right outside the city.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.620
Right now,

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.300
Li Shuang is Taijin's

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.780
only capable military commander.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.310
The officials want this

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.450
to eliminate future threats for good.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.790
I don't know what you've been through
over the past year,

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.870
but I can tell

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.440
that you have some special feelings

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.320
for General Li.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.240
My loyalty to Yao State is absolute

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.150
and pure.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.500
No need to explain.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.960
I trust you, of course.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.960
Taijin and our state

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.480
have been at war for many years,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.080
with countless casualties,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.720
and neither side has gained any advantage.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.120
Now Taijin has a new ruler

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.040
who cares about his people
and puts them first.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.410
This peace negotiation

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.650
might be foreboding the beginning
of a peaceful and prosperous era.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.790
Aodeng,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.650
you've been free-spirited since childhood.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.000
No matter what you do,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.840
you never care about the rules,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.900
acting recklessly

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.960
and refusing to be influenced by others.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.910
Perhaps in the past year,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.360
with so much on your shoulders

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.560
and too many worries,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.730
you've learned to be overly cautious.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.460
As your elder brother,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.520
I hope you can return
to how you used to be

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.760
and follow your heart
in what you believe is right.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.050
Today's your birthday.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080
I've ordered them

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.590
to get you an amulet.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.170
Now that everything has settled,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.510
it's time for you, me, and this kingdom

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.150
to have a new beginning.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.930
At a time like this,

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.690
you still feel like drinking with me?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.890
You're away from home.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.610
At a time like this,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.500
you also need company.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.910
Today, fireworks and firecrackers

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.440
have been going off all day.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.020
Is there some celebration?

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.750
My brother's return to the throne

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.960
has been announced across the state.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.220
He has always been beloved by the people,

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.640
so they're spontaneously celebrating

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.810
the great ruler's return to court.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.260
Peace and prosperity.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.400
How rare indeed.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.400
I wish that in the future,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.369
the whole world could be like this.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.800
How wonderful that would be.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.750
My brother and I have talked it over.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.810
We will release you

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.640
along with the other Taijin prisoners
of war.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.990
We've also sent word
to the Changfeng Army.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.790
Someone should come to pick you up soon.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.530
I am a general of Taijin.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.370
Are you really letting me go this easily?

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.880
I once thought our vendetta

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.810
was inevitable.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.550
But now that the truth has come to light,

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.810
the grudges between us

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.000
should come to an end.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.650
Before your father died, he told me

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.750
that he hoped our two states
could cease fighting

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.210
and build peace together.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.030
And I

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.680
don't want to see
any more innocent people die either.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.340
Besides, when I was in Taijin,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.930
you guys also never mistreated me.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.750
Your Highness,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.510
the imperial palace sent word

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.130
that because today is your birthday,

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.110
His Majesty has arranged a feast
at the palace,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.820
requesting you to head over quickly.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.750
Tell His Majesty

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.750
that it's getting late,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.310
so there's no need to make it a big deal.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.360
Early tomorrow morning,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.960
I'll go express my gratitude in person.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.590
But...

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.680
Do as I say.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.240
Yes, Your Highness.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.960
You don't remember your birthday.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.570
Likewise, I've been a drifter,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.320
so I don't know mine either.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.750
How about we make today

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.310
our shared birthday?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.270
So today

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.110
is your real birthday.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.050
Since it's your birthday,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.080
I should show you some respect.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.690
This cup of wine

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.640
is to wish you a long life.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.810
I may not be so talented,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.980
but today I'll perform

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.750

There is

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.200
a long journey ahead.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.180
I've prepared some food for you.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.130
You can eat when you're hungry.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.230
Thank you.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.850
Belated kindness.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.130
Thank you.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.830
You can stay in Yao State

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:04.550
if you want to.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.040
I can settle you down

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.750
somewhere else.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.590
And about the fireworks that day,

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.440
if you liked them...

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.070
That day,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.440
I was drunk and behaved inappropriately.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.890
Please forgive me, Prince Annan.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.720
Now that everywhere is at peace,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.440
just let bygones

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.000
be bygones.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.440
Jin'an is already dead.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.660
I should have realized it.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.030
Wait.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.720
Since you're leaving,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.080
I'll return this hairpin

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.880
to its owner.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.490
Since it's over between us,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.680
what's the point

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.160
of keeping such stuff?

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.150
Take care, Prince Annan.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.260
Welcome back, Grand General, General Li.
Let's head back to the capital.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.590
Are you and Mo Yin

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.920
planning to return to Wuling Mountain?

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.160
So there's nothing I can hide from you.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.160
It's been a while

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.690
since we left the mountain.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.480
As the Master of the Mountain,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.770
he has more important things
to deal with, of course.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.160
I can't be too selfish.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.640
We're already in Taijin territory now.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.240
With Ji Ran and others escorting you,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.300
I can rest assured.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.850
Seems like Mo Yin

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.510
has been taking good care of you.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.350
You're so caring about him.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.680
Who's caring about him?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.960
I'm just

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.640
taking this opportunity

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.440
to go back

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.730
to replenish my herbal stock.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.480
How are things going

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.810
between you and Jin'an?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.860
You once promised to accompany each other

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.260
and grow old together.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.929
Don't you think it'll be a shame

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.790
if you don't give it another shot?

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.590
We once fell deeply in love
with each other.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.530
It's true.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.659
But he remembers neither the past

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.480
nor me.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.630
This is also true.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.400
In this world,

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.840
gatherings

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.510
and partings

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.920
are all part of fate.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.590
It's just fate playing with us.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.670
If that's the case,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.880
let me take this away.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.340
So it won't remind you of him,
giving you heartache.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.980
The emotional ties

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.930
are intertwined and complicated.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.630
You should at least give me some time

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.760
to cut them off one by one.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.610
Since you've decided to let go,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.670
you should do it decisively.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.360
You're a general.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.140
Where's that decisive warrior
you once were?

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.570
It's getting late.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.340
I'll take my leave.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.550
Shuang,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.060
take care of yourself.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.590
Shuang.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.150
Actually, Jin'an has already...

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.150
You should go now.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.420
Don't keep Mo Yin waiting.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.630
I made your favorite pear-blossom pastries

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.690
and wanted to bring them here
while they're still warm.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.660
I remember I fell in love

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.480
with a woman in Taijin.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.940
You are the Prince Annan of Yao State.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.230
Falling in love with a woman from Taijin

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.820
will not end well.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.960
What if I were not the Prince Annan?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.180
[Here rest the Yao warriors
of loyalty and bravery.]

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.420
His Majesty has returned.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.750
The Empress Dowager Qin
has fallen from power.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.320
The war is over.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.360
The people are safe.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.180
Being buried here,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.460
you will be able to witness

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.960
the peaceful

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.410
and prosperous future

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.630
of Yao State.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.670
[From now on,]

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.370
[there will no longer be
the Prince Annan who wages war.]

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.180
[May the world remain peaceful.]

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.760
[May you, heroic warriors, rest in peace.]

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.880
I, Li Shuang,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.000
have escorted my father, Li Wei, back.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.710
Despite the unsuccessful peace negotiation
this time,

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.170
Emperor Duan Aoze
has reclaimed the throne.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.650
He's benevolent and not fond of wars.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.670
Perhaps there's hope for peace

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.530
between our two nations.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.670
Grand General Li Wei

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.140
sacrificed himself for the greater good

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.520
and died for his state.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.130
He's hereby posthumously granted

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.140
the title of Duke of Loyalty and Courage

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.270
to honor his virtue.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.480
Please allow me to express my gratitude

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.340
for your grace
on behalf of my father, Your Majesty.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.160
You may rise now.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.670
A wise ruler should be fair

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.070
with rewards and punishments.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.760
Given

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.960
Li Wei's contributions,

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.560
he's already been rewarded.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.440
However,

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.280
Li Shuang committed a grave crime.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.480
Your Majesty, please

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.590
punish her with no mercy.
